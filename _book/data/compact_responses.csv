1,0,"To infringe on student freedoms for funding not only goes against Vanderbilt's stance of ""neutrality"" but is blatantly corrupt. As a top school, it is belittiling and even insulting that the school considers signing a contraxt which inherently lends itself to right-wing ideologies when campus should be an open space for communication."
2,0,"Higher education should not be beholden to the political agenda of a federal administration. We are the front line that must defend against intensifying threats to the operation and integrity of American higher education. Additionally, this would be a clear violation of institutional neutrality because the terms expand far beyond simple protections of federal funding, an issue on which the school is understandably not neutral."
3,0,Vague language used
4,0,This is nonsense
5,0,they would have too much control over our political views and expression
6,0,Especially the last part is detrimental to our free speech society. That’s dictatorship stuff right there. Not that all of it isn’t completely and utterly un-American.
7,0,"The underlying context and intentions of this Compact are inherently contradictory to Vanderbilt’s cornerstone ideologies on political dialogue, an inclusive student body, and a safe community on campus."
8,1,I agree with every requirement that the school needs to meet.
9,0,"There shouldn't be a capping point for international students. While our current student body doesn't exceed that amount, having a limit applies pressure to those who apply. Also, while ""hard science"" is important, giving them full tuition would take away financial aid given to other students in any other major. Lastly, punishing departments that oppose conservative ideas is very broad, and it goes against the purpose of education, to challenge ideas and create change."
10,0,Institutional neutrality
11,0,"This is part of Trump's authoritarian take over. Much of it is good, like freezing tuition and grade integrity, but dismantling voices that go against conservatism is wrong. We are a private institution with free speech. This is a clear violation and wrongful extension of executive power."
12,0,"While some aspects of the proposal can be beneficial, by supporting the trump administrations attack on higher education directly disrespects the diversity and community integral to our student body and the Vanderbilt campus. Furthermore by signing this deal we are indirectly harming other institutions, while collaboration within Vanderbilt is important this mindset needs to be shared across other university. Additionally this proposal pushed for punishment against non conservative values, while respect is vital to constructive conversations banning certain forms of language is a direct attack against our first amendment rights. Lastly by supporting this we are letting the admiration gain power over higher education. Candidly this is a bully attempt and I think we are stronger than this."
13,0,"Make this as hard for this administration as you can, don’t capitulate without a fight"
14,1,"The guidelines laid out are completely reasonable if not necessary. These guidelines will improve the student pool by reassuring the quality of students, while allowing more opportunity for American students. I think data transparency will help the views and ratings of Vanderbilt and add a layer of accountability to the administration. Institutional neutrality is necessary, and while Vanderbilt does a good job, it is important to recognize that colleges across the country (including Vanderbilt), are disproportionately liberal which can skew the perspective of neutral and/or ""middle ground""."
15,0,It wouldn’t uphold the statement of neutrality that Vanderbilt strives for
16,0,"As it stands, the AADS department is “under review.” That is all this compact is about. It will never be about making education more affordable or acceptable, it’s about teaching white kids that white people never do anything wrong and all other people are the enemy."
17,0,Last line is ridiculous. We should not.
18,0,The vague language instated in the order would directly undermine and effectively eradicate Vanderbilt’s stated commitment to free speech. The government having a say in who gets punished for saying what will have a chilling effect on free speech that is not conservative in nature. There is clearly a political agenda behind this compact due to its explicit naming of conservative ideas and it seeking to come after programs and initiatives that promote equality. Also this compact inherently implies the superiority of stem subjects over humanities and that alone is very harmful.
19,0,Kinda common sense
20,1,International enrollment levels don’t really add to the campus. They are very insular. It’s just competing for the same jobs American Vandy students want.
21,0,I’m worried about the precedent that this will set for the future if we allow politicians to be involved in higher ed
22,0,I believe it would entirely contradict our policy of institutional neutrality.
23,0,the compact is a ploy to curb the freedom and self-determination of our university
24,0,"Standardized tests are not always the best indicator of academic excellence and participation. Especially with the extremely profitable industry of test preparation and the costs of accommodation testing. The reflection of individuals should be on the contribution to their community, which will determine whether they will succeed within such a community-based institution. Also, the international student pull allows for a diversified student body and fosters global connections and collaborations. I think there is merit to the proposed amendments, especially the tuition freeze, but there are many disadvantages to the proposal holistically and it leads me to question whether the compliance monitoring will be used for the instructed purposes and nothing more."
25,0,This is an attempt by the federal government to restrict the academic freedoms of universities.
26,0,"Goes against principle neutrality, actively targets and harms many members of the Vanderbilt community"
27,0,I think some aspects are beneficial but others are unreasonable
28,0,Universities are supposed to be a safe place for students to safely share their opinions and ideas. If we sign the contract that will limit student’s abilities to share their voices. How are we supposed to dare to grow if our voices are controlled?
29,0,we should not sign this trump agreement
30,1,"Amazing work by the Trump Administration. I support protecting free speech and institutional neutrality, along with everything else listed. Should be a no brainer for Vanderbilt."
31,0,"Complying with the conditions set by this compact would threaten our right to free speech, because what is an idea that “even sparks political violence”."
32,0,"This is inhumane. Not only will this affect minorities that require the educational opportunities offered at Vandy, but at any other university for that matter. Dont let an"
33,0,If we bend to his will it is over for us as a country.
34,0,"I don’t like the idea that the department of Justice has sole responsibility to determine if we are following the agreement. Since some of the policies are vague and cannot be easily measured, the department of justice would have a hold over Vanderbilt and could threaten to revoke funds whenever they want."
35,0,"Signing this compact violates principle neutrality, would be cowardly, would alienate much of the student body, and would make me embarrassed to attend this school."
36,0,"I think agreeing to the compact is a direct contradiction to the freedom of speech that higher institutions promote and thrive upon. Universities are meant to be a place of discourse, and restricting certain types of speech directly goes against the First Amendment. Restricting professors from certain statements directly contradicts their First Amendment rights. Additionally, “Universities would be required to define terms like ‘male,’ ‘female,’ ‘woman,’ and ‘man’ using the Trump administration’s definition, which is tied to biological processes and reproductive function.” This severely harms the transgender community. No administration should be able to define someone’s gender for them. Gender is a social construct, and freedom should be given to all citizens to express themselves in the way they would like. If Vanderbilt wants to be a place of inclusion to all, they will not agree to this. Why must “Universities…reform or remove units that ‘punish, belittle, or incite violence against conservative ideas,’ while still enforcing rules against harassment and incitement.”? Why does this only apply to one political ideology? Such statements further the political polarization of the United States, which is what initially led to immense division. Though born on American soil, I am a daughter of two immigrants. The only reason I am here and able to live the way I do and pursue higher education is because of their choice to move to the United States. Without support for immigrants, our country wouldn’t have made much of the progress that it did. It is a nation built on immigrants and those of diverse heritages and backgrounds. This is why I do not believe in limiting international applicants. The United States should be a place of diversity, and the “American Dream” pushes promise and opportunity. If we restrict international students from attending, we stray from the ideals that made this country what it is. America should provide opportunity to all, especially if they want to pursue education here. Most current Americans are not from the American indigenous population, which means that most current citizens actually come from a family that immigrated here at one point in time. I urge Vanderbilt to not agree to this compact. I think it defies the basic values of the university, as well as the beliefs that this nation was founded upon. If signed, Vanderbilt will lose respect in the eyes of many, as they will be agreeing to partner with a government administration that oppresses and diminishes many American groups and further pushes political divides."
37,0,"Negotiate on points about free speech and academic freedom, otherwise a good deal, but currently a violation of free speech"
38,0,"As a student deeply committed to the values of academic freedom, inclusion, and independent thought, I am strongly opposed to the proposed Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education. Although it presents itself as a framework for improvement, this proposal is a clear intrusion of federal authority into the academic and moral autonomy of universities. Measures such as enforcing rigid, biologically based definitions of sex, banning consideration of race and gender in admissions and hiring, and capping international enrollment would severely undermine the diversity and openness that make higher education so enriching. Additionally, tying federal funding to compliance with politically charged standards threatens to turn universities into extensions of federal policy rather than spaces of free inquiry. The proposed tuition freeze, standardized testing requirements, and cost-control measures also fail to account for the financial and social complexities that universities face, particularly in supporting underrepresented students. I urge Vanderbilt’s administration to reject this Compact and to uphold the institution’s responsibility to protect academic independence, foster diversity, and ensure that all students are free to learn, think, and speak without government interference."
39,0,"The compact's clear intention is to reduce the number of international students as well as the diversity of our student body with respect to race, ethnicity, gender, and other markers of identity. This opposes Vanderbilt's mission to encourage diverse ideas that come from different perspectives and lived experiences. It seems straightforward to me that the compact does not align with this value, which is important not only for the cultivation of a liberal arts environment but also for creative and innovative advancement in Vanderbilt's research and development interests. Additionally, the compact's aim to protect conservative free speech is simply a less effective way of trying to accomplish what Vanderbilt is already surprisingly good at. I have been impressed by the existence of a true culture of free speech at this university which is lacking in much of American higher education. Space is made for, and respect given to, conservative opinions expressed at this institution, and I don't think we need ""help"" in that regard from the Trump administration."
40,0,"This is ridiculous. Vanderbilt is a private university that people pay A LOT of money to attend, and now they might not call people by the name they choose??!! FDT!!!!"
41,0,"This is not only disastrous to the goal of dialogue on campus by limiting the number of different and unique voices that can have a place at our campus, but it is also bending to a specific partisan overreach of power. This directly violates the fundamental idea of institutional neutrality that the university covets."
42,0,The international student cap is ridiculous and shows the nationalistic tendencies of the current administration
43,1,"I think the administration's viewpoints are fair and reflect a common sense approach to higher education. I think the report on administration costs and holding price constant for five years are valid for the nation's situation. I also like the idea of defining ""male"" and ""female"" as the administration has. I don't appreciate the wealthy school clause, but understand that it's generally accepted that the US could use more STEM majors. Overall, I think the Compact is a good idea."
44,0,The federal government should not have access to student records. I am also concerned about the cap on international students.
45,0,A private institution should be able to make its own decisions about admissions hiring and research. Government supervision of what it’s taught is wrong. Pushing a political agenda and forcing people to not oppose other’s beliefs is an attack on free speech.
46,0,This compact contradicts our schools commitment to institutional neutrality.
47,0,"We can't sign the compact as it is. Even though we might get federal funding, and some parts align with our mission like institutional neutrality, we should not define things like sex by Trump's definition. This would reverse all our progress towards gender equality and inclusivity, and seeing as gender is a political issue now, this would not really be institutional neutrality in practice. Also, we cannot cap international students, as they make up a very important part of our student population and provide us with so many new perspectives."
48,0,I think women and international students foster a great community here on campus and the compact will only make these communities not feel as safe as they do now.
49,1,"I especially agree with the tuition freeze and capping of international students, more spots should be given to those in the US"
50,0,It is NOT neutral at all
51,0,"I identify with many conservative beliefs. Punishing departments which “purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas"" goes against not only Vanderbilt's commitment to free and open dialogue, but also our rights as citizens to uphold our freedom of expression. We cannot uphold freedom of expression without cultivating it, which is why we need departments diverse in thought, rhetoric, and education. All ideologies must be scrutinized in order to discover the validity of claims and merits of following a given ideologies. Should Vanderbilt not uphold its commitment of ""institutional neutrality"" just because of a threat of federal funding? I implore the university to keep it's commitments that drew me to attend Vanderbilt and the many donors that invest in Vanderbilt because of it's dedication to institutional neutrality."
52,0,Do not capitulate to the Trump admin. for any and every demand like this. Doing so will instantly delegitimize the institution as a place for academic freedom.
53,0,"We should not be aligning ourselves with this administration, or any administration in general. They are trying to silence free speech and spread ignorance."
54,0,"I think signing the contract would go against Vanderbilt’s own values of freedom of speech and neutrality. By signing the contract, Vanderbilt is under trump’s influence. Although suffering consequences of not signing the compact, Vanderbilt will remain committed to its values in the long run."
55,0,"I think this will significantly limit the institution's academic prestige. Not only that international scholars are one of the main reasons why the institution holds the high academic standards, many of our undergrads choose to become that international student in other countries for study abroad. It would be very much hypocritical if we choose to limit the international population not considering the fact that how much we benefit from them and how much we choose to benefit by the idea of global education. Furthermore, grade transparency and especially the concerns regarding grade inflation is not applicable to all majors / colleges, and in fact, many STEM and other rmost rigorous majors struggle with the exact opposite concept of that. Vanderbilt is unique in a way that there is a wide range of variance in academic settings per major in terms of rigor, class structure, faculty:student ratio, and grade. It would be very much problematic if we try to implement all the things as-is thinking that it would reflect our institution as a whole and cause many issues that not only impact immediately to current students/faculty but also the ""brand"" and reputation of the institution as a whole, which I assume, we all care very much."
56,1,"Tuition inflation, in conjunction with administrative bloat, has made higher education increasingly expensive in proportion to its real value. A large number of conditions in the compact would address this. For one, grade inflation checks would mean more resolution at the high end. In the current landscape, a high GPA means nothing, particularly outside of stem. Other guidelines such as competency based hiring would likely lower administrative bloat, as well as more enforced fiscal responsibility through the cost controls. Transparent student outcomes and the requirement of standardized tests would create a more equitable and healthily competitive landscape for performance. Of course, the tuition freeze is also advantageous to students."
57,0,"Do we have email addresses for Board of Trust (BOT) members? They are ""the bosses"" of the Chancellor. If we have their email addresses, students and faculty could lobby directly to the BOT Members."
58,0,"While holding tuition is appealing to many and seems reasonable, it is against the morals of elite US schools to promote an emphasis towards only enrolling American students. Additionally, removing race and gender-based admission negates affirmative action that would otherwise be crucial to supporting individuals of all backgrounds, not just those who are of a particular race majority or are well-supported financially. Vanderbilt promotes all ideas on campus, not aligning with solely conservative or democratic values, but accepting diversity of opinion."
59,0,This compact is part of a direct threat to democracy and free speech in the next generation.
60,0,Fuck fascists
61,0,None
62,0,"It opens the door to being taken advantage of in the future - if we give in now for something, its stuff that the government can leverage against us / threaten to take away unless Vanderbilt implements even more policies"
63,0,"Under the Compact I would not have been allowed into Vanderbilt. All my Dual Enrollment college credits, none of which I graded less than 90% on, would have meant anything in absence of an SAT or ACT score. Beyond that, the final demand is worded so vaguely that almost any institution could be targeted depending on what the accuser defines Conservative as. I fear that I might be affected by this in the future"
64,0,Most of the students at Vanderbilt are international and many people study and come to Vanderbilt for their clubs focusing on gender and race.
65,0,This is significant government overreach that will result in drastically reduced free speech on campus. This is a Trojan horse that would allow the government to legally censor speech and propaganda.
66,0,"It is a violation of institutional neutrality, as well as giving up constitutional rights. This is unconstitutional and un-american, do not sign the compact, or any compact."
67,0,I believe the compact limits Vanderbilt’s sovereignty
68,0,absolutely not.
69,0,"I think this would provide a dangerous precedent for higher education ceding to federal demands in a way not authorized by Congress. I believe signing a compact that provides preferential treatment to signing universities violates much of what Vanderbilt stands for in terms of Institutional Neutrality and simply as an independent entity in the educational space. Though there are many changes in the Compact that I agree with and believe would be beneficial, this cannot be the way that change is made, as it must come from the University itself, not from the federal government."
70,1,"Given that international students are not currently affected, I agree with the other points in the compact."
71,0,Academic freedom shouldn’t be restricted by the menace of subsidy.
72,0,"I think the compact sets precedent for how much control the federal government has over freedom of speech and expression on college campuses. Especially with limitations to departments that may encourage more discourse between students and the community, it does not seem fair to put harsh limitations on what students or full departments are allowed to say/teach/discuss."
73,0,This would completely take away all student autonomy and the ability for self-expression. It would spark fear among many students that their ideas have government oversight.
74,0,"it’s racist, transphobic, and xenophobic"
75,0,"Impact to international students and minorities is buried within other seemingly good changes (tuition freeze, tuition free for hard science majors)"
76,0,"This compact does not follow institutional neutrality and violates the rights of the students. Sharing certain student records with federal agencies on request violates privacy. Additionally, ""threatening conservative ideals"" is poorly defined and will, under this administration, be used to limit the free speech of students and is an attack on academic freedom for both students and professors. Additionally, this threatens the identities of students who do not align with ""conservative values"". As Drew Spiegel noted in the hustler, this is the wrong way to implement institutional changes."
77,0,The continuous bowing down to the Trump Administration will lead to a decreasing level of care for the little diversity Vanderbilt already has.
78,0,Race and gender admissions help level out the playing field for under resourced communities
79,0,NO NO NO!!!!
80,0,"It provides a strong bias for hard sciences, but the humanities are just as important. Also, universities, being private, should not have instructions on what they can and cannot teach by the government."
81,0,"The last part of the compact is a deal-breaker. That is a very vague area that can be construed to make even the slightest opposition to conservative ideology an area of conflict that the U.S government would then have financial leverage over in order to comply with their standards. The same standards need to be applied across all parties and beliefs in general. Not only does this compact blatantly violate the first amendment right to free speech—including the right to “belittle” anyone you please—this could, though extreme, be part of a fascist movement that attempts to silence people for political and financial gain. If the compact did not include the last statement, or at least an altered version of it to where it would apply to everything said against another people on campus, then I would agree with signing the compact. But, as is, this compact is not worth signing, and is quite frankly just handing over a private university’s right to function as it pleases to the government."
82,0,"I think regulating international student enrollment is only good if you are preventing these students from being exploited and give them resources that protect them if they have to unenroll for any reason. Otherwise I think it’s just xenophobia masked as concern for Americans. Affirmative action is in place to uplift high performing students who if not considered in a holistic light, would not be given the same opportunities. It’s not about disparaging the students who have opportunity, it’s about supporting people who don’t. I also fear that if we accept this funding, especially with no clear outline of what departments are and how they are purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.” that we risk the quality of education available at Vanderbilt. Education should not align with any particular political belief, but we live in a time where objective fact is politically controversial. How would they determine what is bias against conservatives, and what is just facts and history that don’t support conservative beliefs? Also if it gets implemented it cannot be one sided, efforts to belittle left leaning ideologies deserve the same respect. We also cannot lessen the quality of education and students access to opinion, facts, and historical accounts just because it could hurt someone’s feelings. There’s no way we could implement this and rightfully deserve to be ranked as a top university. It cannot be implemented in a feasible way. I don’t support violence against conservatives, but this is not protecting anyone. It is not protecting free speech, it is amplifying one opinion and not allowing for thoughtful discussion or debate. We should address violence, but this is not the solution."
83,0,"If Vanderbilt is is to truly adhere to the “Principled neutrality” value that Diermeier values, we should not be aligning ourselves with any presidential agenda."
84,0,"I don't oppose the contents of the compact, I oppose submitting to the federal government, especially since Vanderbilt is dedicated to critical thinking and open dialogue. Additionally, the compact would diminish the diverse student body we have by reducing international students and incentivizing hard science majors."
85,1,The university already is in alignment with many of these ideals. I believe it would be beneficial to sign on. Free speech is a great thing to promote on college campuses and making everyone feel okay to share their thoughts is a necessity for a successful institution.
86,0,"The disruption clause is too nondescript. Do students reserve the right to protest peacefully? Also this: ""Departments that target conservative views."" C'mon guys you know what signing this can lead to. Stand against this idiocracy."
87,0,We need change in America. Not go back to old standards.
88,0,"Regardless of the content of the compact, in many students' eyes, this would undermine the stance of political neutrality which Vanderbilt holds. Speaking in terms of the compact's contents, though, many of these measures are largely just punitive, which does not align with the collaborative spirit that most people would regard a true ""compact"" to hold."
89,1,"I think we should fight eliminating race as a consideration in admissions but we should sign it regardless. We are under the cap for international students. We are likely already heading toward the standardized testing mandates. We are underneath the endowment mark that would force us to give stem students free tuition. Therefore, we largely do not have to change our existing policies, and would recieve a large amount of federal funding in signing this compact."
90,1,"i can agree with most of the terms with an exception of taking action against departments which ""purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas"""
91,0,The last component is the hard deal breaker as it's straight biased censorship
92,0,"I would question the piece about extending help for “hard science majors”. That is very difficult to truly measure, people switch majors all the time and funding would be very difficult to track."
93,0,Direct federal oversight of private institutions is very concerning. The Compact needs to be edited significantly.
94,0,"I do not believe in allowing politics to dictate education, no matter which party it is trying to influence us. We are a private institution, and this feels like a bribe to do as the current administration says. I especially dislike the idea that organizations cannot criticize conservative values. This would dismantle organizations such as the Vanderbilt Democrats and many others. Students need to be allowed to share and discuss idea, no matter which side of the political spectrum they are on."
95,0,I think there should be a additional safety net for federal funding without tying it towards signing the document.
96,1,"I believe a lot of the provisions of the Compact such as data transparency, requiring SAT/ACT scores, and promoting free speech would increase Vanderbilt’s prestige and academic enviroment"
97,0,It will put our campus at risk for restricted protest and speech
98,0,Many of the guidelines in the compact are a gross overreach of the federal government on higher education and it would be a disgrace for Vanderbilt to be complacent with it. The good ideas sprinkled in and between clear authoritarianism does not warrant our signing of the compact.
99,0,Don’t let money change your values
100,0,Fuck that Oompa Loompa. The compact demonstrates a direct attack on certain groups and reeks of favoritism and bribery to hopefully have higher educational facilities’ beliefs aligned with his own
101,0,"This isn’t a dictatorship, and Trump is out of control and so far out of line."
102,0,"I worry about the precedent that this would set allowing the government to intervene in what schools are teaching. I do not think a private school should be instructed to teach in a certain way by the government. This feels like a scary, as historically speaking government intervention in higher education has been a sign of Authoritarianism and I would not want the government to be intervening in American higher education."
103,0,Pushing public political agendas in private institutions should be banned instead.
104,0,I feel like the university should stay nonpartisan and try to stay independent from the gov.
105,0,"The federal government has no place in dictating the requirements set by a university for admission. Why should the federal government get a say in whether a private university is test-optional in its admissions process? The vague wording of the compact is also concerning. What defines a ""hard science""? Does biology count as a hard science? What about ecology? Climate studies? How would the federal government delineate between ""belittling"" conservative views and critiquing conservative talking points? The compact's specific mention of protecting ""conservative viewpoints"" is also alarming. The compact claims to be promoting free speech and institutional neutrality, yet the compact itself cannot even pretend to be neutral and unbiased. Why are conservative ideas specifically singled out as needing protection? This all reads as a thinly veiled attempt by the Trump administration to hijack private education."
106,0,"Of course not!! The government is trying to implement conservative affiliation in our classrooms with things like defining man/women according to Trump administration perspective. And technically anything promoting liberal views could be interpreted as targeting conservative views, which is not institutionally neutral at all. Garbage compact, trump administration is so ridiculously stupid."
107,0,I don’t think it’s a good idea for the university to jeopardize its own freedom.
108,0,This is a disgusting oversight of federal power. The government should not be using financial incentives as a way to get top universities to comply with their agenda.
109,0,"The Trump administration should not be able to declare how this university is run. In particular, the international students section of the compact would have an extremely negative impact on our campus community. Everyone deserves a quality education, no matter their race, gender, home country, etc."
110,0,"I think even if I like the concept of potentially cheaper tuition or even free tuition for certain majors. Personally, I would switch my major or double major and take the extra years needed if it was free. However, I think theres a fundamental lack of principle and self-respect with that decision. Should we be forced to conform? Even if we agree with some of it the decision it self is a bow to authority. A authority that I feel is growing rapidly distant from its own people. Its a complicated situation, and in the end I believe in Vanderbilt to make the best call."
111,1,"I think that it should be signed in general, but the clause about conservative ideals and defining gender worry me; they are fine as worded, but give the possibility of unfair/unbalanced control over the schools actions as it is a bit vauge."
112,1,I’m a moderate and I don’t think any of these requests are really that controversial
113,0,Do not give in to tyranny
114,0,Its conditions erase marginalized students and put free expression at risk.
115,0,"The compact tries to appear fair while sneaking in an alternate agenda of shutting down any speech against conservative themes, limiting free speech. This is an overstep of political power against a private institution"
116,0,"There are some guidelines within the compact that would limit the student body such as reinstatement of standardized testing, definition of sex/gender, and international student cap."
117,0,I think that signing would violate our core principle of institutional neutrality and also demonstrate support for complete federal overreach and negatively affect many marginalized groups on campus.
118,0,"This will send the message to the student body that the entire motto of Vanderbilt, ""Dare to Grow"" is more ""Comply and Deny"" as majority of the student body is strongly against these barriers being placed that will alter the culture and free speech of the school, as well as the accessibility of the school."
119,0,don’t like trump
120,0,Do not sign anything.
121,0,"This violates my rights, specifically my freedom of speech."
122,1,I agree with both the guidelines and think the funding would be great for vanderbilt.
123,0,"To protect Vanderbilt's position as a bastion of free speech, civil discourse, and the iterative process that is the pursuit of truth. To sign on to an agreement with the Trump Administration that is extortionary by nature, Vanderbilt would forfeit its ability to pursue and disseminate knowledge. We do not need some arbitrary balance of ideologues within each subunit of our campus, from academic departments to student organizations."
124,0,"Well first of all, why would you trust a felon? Why would you trust a man whos ancestors arent even native to the very land he’s trying to push everybody else out of?"
125,0,"It is a blatant overreach for the government to have any say in the curriculum, hiring practices, gender policies, or functioning of a private university. This would be overreach under any administration but is a fascist choice by the Trump administration and would directly harm the student body at Vanderbilt. I would be appalled if our university complied and would be disappointed if our student government failed to speak out."
126,0,Government should NOT have input on private universities!
127,1,"At least for our school, it doesn’t have any negative effects. Like yes it would bring back standardized tests (which I feel like is need since our school is at the rank it is), but the free tuition for the students studying the harder science degrees this could be life changing. Like this school is really really expensive and when I got my financial aid package, it honestly was not good and I couldn’t afford to go to this school, but I got lucky enough and got a full tuition merit scholarship."
128,0,To capitulate to the Trump administration by agreeing to this contract is absolutely absurd and asinine. To sign this contract goes against every reason I chose to come to Vanderbilt in the first place. I would be deeply disappointed and appalled by any decision regarding this contract other than for Vanderbilt to quite literally say: “fuck this.”
129,0,"I agree with points 1, 3, 4, and 8 in the Compact. I fear point 5 might result in reduced job placement (as some employers might fail to consider the rigor of the university). I also fear point 7 might result in reduced financial aid, making the university only accessible to the wealthy. Point 6 addresses a problem for which (I believe) there is no solution -- gender nonconforming and transgender rights versus women's rights. So, I am unsure about this point. Point 2 sounds nice, but the vague language allows the government to give preference to whichever party is in power (conservative right now). But the primary reason I do not believe Vanderbilt should sign the compact is that noncompliant universities will ""forego federal benefits."" This vague language seems to me a clear overreach of power, which can only be counteracted by a refusal to ""play the game."""
130,0,"As someone with very little knowledge as to what this thing actually does, I’m going based only on my instincts."
131,0,"undemocratic, unconstitutional, institutional bullying."
132,1,I have no idea why anyone would be against this all the request seem perfectly logical
133,0,"Vanderbilt is a place to learn, think, debate and explore new field of interest. The federal government has no authority to force and bully university to encourage one type of political thinking. Chancellor claims to be a person of neutrality, he should everything in his power to reject the deal to maintain Vanderbilt independence."
134,1,"This compact has made me think about a lot. I should start by emphasizing that I deplore Donald Trump and many of his policies, so I expected to hate this one as well. However, having read through the terms of the compact, I am surprised to say that I generally like its terms. My only hesitance comes from the fear that our compliance could be used to enforce future more arbitrary and or partisan rules in the future. I have a few friends like me who are also moderate democrats and feel the same way, but I am very curious to see what the implications of signing will be."
135,0,"The proposed Compact is an alarming overreach that directly undermines the autonomy, inclusivity, and academic freedom that define institutions like Vanderbilt. Mandating outdated and politically motivated definitions of sex erases the lived experiences and identities of many students and faculty, violating the spirit of nondiscrimination in our Student Handbook. Requiring standardized tests again ignores the vast research showing their socioeconomic and racial bias, while banning the consideration of race or gender in admissions and hiring actively reverses decades of progress toward equity. Capping international enrollment discourages global collaboration and diversity, values that are foundational to higher education. Even more concerning, allowing the Department of Justice to “monitor adherence” threatens universities’ independence and opens the door to political surveillance of academic spaces. Though transparency and free speech are important, these measures are being used here as a guise for ideological control. Vanderbilt should reject this Compact not only because it contradicts our institutional commitments, but because it sets a dangerous precedent of federal intrusion into university governance and academic expression."
136,0,"compact mandates go against both biological and sociological understandings of race and gender, and disregard the fact that background is a major factor in how admissions are weighed. In addition, the content regulations along party lines could be taken to rewrite entire curricula due to vague definitions, going against scientific knowledge in the worst cases."
137,0,I think the notion of trying to get an institution to sign any kind of deal simply to avoid prosecution and persecution by the government is a violation of the independence of the institutions and the values of building and protecting a democratic society.
138,0,Capitulation isn't the answer and isn't an isolated choice by one university-- there's little accountability on the federal side to honor this agreement even if vanderbilt dutifully abides by all the freedom- and autonomy-limiting measures. A yes would cripple the independent capacity for thought in higher education
139,1,It seems that Vanderbilt already follows most if not all of the demands listed. It would seem foolish not to accept them.
140,0,it’s hard for international
141,0,"I believe in institutional neutrality and free expression, this compact is antithetical to institutional neutrality and free expression"
142,0,It goes against all of my moral and ethical opinions. It makes getting to higher education extremely difficult for many populations now
143,0,"We have the ability to make a stance to fight against a dictatorship. Vanderbilt's position could not only harm current students but deter future prospective students if they were to sign the Compact. This Compact weaponizes funding to force universities to comply with Trump's ideological rules. It's controlling and academic freedom is taken away. Vanderbilt prides themselves on neutrality but this Compact is government-enforced silence on social issues and scientific facts. This Compact is so unbelievably harmful I would be ashamed to be a Vanderbilt graduate if they signed it. Forcing faculty and administrators to legally deny trans and intersex people's existence is such a violation of human rights. As a climate studies major the whole ""free speech protection"" clause of this Compact is a trap. It only protects one kind of speech: conservative speech. It empowers political appointees to dismantle any academic unit that discusses systemic racism, climate justice, or gender equity. Entire majors in climate science, EES, geology, ecology, public health, gender and sexuality studies, women studies, sociology, psychology, public policy, anthropology, ALL foreign languages, and so many more at this university would receive censorship that limits our education. It's a fact that Trump's actions of pulling out of the Paris Treaty and so many more horrifying actions affect sustainability and climate change. How are my professors not allowed to say that?? We should not let politicians dictate our research OR TEACHING. Hearing my professors fear what they say is horrifying and an infringement on our rights. Signing the Compact would turn neutrality into submission."
144,1,"I believe it to be for the best in Vandy’s research and future in the sciences to support the compact. In these times, signing it would save Vandy from more political punitive measures while supporting our faculty."
145,0,I feel it does not align with our “institutional neutrality”
146,0,Some of the terms in this compact directly go against Vanderbilt's dedication to inclusion and should not be accepted as they are.
147,0,"I believe the Trump administration issuing demands to schools (especially those considered to have prestige) is simply not democratic or constitutional. After reviewing the compact, all I can think of is the irony and hypocrisy in its language. This administration claims they would like to “protect free speech,” but within the same compact, wants to restrict the vocabulary we are allowed to use in the classrooms about gender and sex to comply with their definitions. I know that these demands issued by this administration place pressure that I could not even imagine handling if I were on the administrative side of this issue. We have seen how they have come after Harvard for refusing. That said, Vanderbilt would not be the inclusive campus it is today without the students that this compact directly harms. The cap on international students, as well as the strict definition terms for the expression of gender and sex identity, reflect this administration's explicit biases towards those groups. This bias does not belong at a private institution, and the government should not be able to control who feels welcome here. We cannot “dare to grow” in an environment where we feel unsafe to express ourselves freely."
148,0,The compact rule takes away the ability for various types of students to be great and slowly starts to push success for only one certain group(read between the lines).
149,0,"Beyond my thoughts on the specific elements of the Compact, Vanderbilt must not sign it if it wishes to have any moral grounding on its ""principled neutrality"" concept. If Vanderbilt chooses to sign onto this Compact, we will see that principled neutrality was never truly neutral; it was an excuse for apathy when the University did not want to engage in public issues."
150,0,This is government overreach (regardless of what party is pushing for it). Education should be regulated but not controlled by the government.
151,0,Abuse of federal power. Can't force higher institutions to adhere to political values through what is effectively monetary bribes.
152,0,No Department of Justice oversight.
153,0,This is ridiculous. The Trump administration doesn't want the betterment of others they want to push their own agenda. The Vanderbilt community deserves and stands for better.
154,0,To remain apolitical and neutral I don’t think we should start a precedent of doing whatever a sitting president asks us to do
155,0,that’s discrimination.
156,0,"I voted for Donald Trump out of dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party's mishandling of the Biden administration and the botched Presidential Primary. I consider myself fiscally liberal and socially conservative (religious purposes). This pact is much too aggressive; I am particularly concerned about the provision for silencing anti-conservative groups on campus. Provisions already exist to prevent groups from spreading genuinely harmful rhetoric, so why does this need to be included? I would agree with the conservative assessment that higher education has become too much of a liberal echo chamber, but this is not fixed by silencing anti-conservative groups. I do agree with removing race and gender based admissions and hiring, and the capping of international enrollment, and I believe the financial portion of the compact would be beneficial for the university and its students. I am hoping for a revised version of this compact to be resubmitted and voted on again."
157,0,"In my Culture, Advocacy, and Leadership classes we are learning the importance of narratives and playing responsibility in a sport where rules seem to be out the window. I transferred to Vanderbilt because of the culture of respect to dialog and opposing ideas. My life has been enriched far more than I can describe because of it.   I've experienced what it's like to be in a classroom where ideas and issues cannot be discussed and seen offices that ensure students are included be shut down because the institution was not able to stick to their founding values and principles."
158,0,"I agree that tuition rates should not significantly increase in the duration of someone attending Vanderbilt (initial offer vs future offers), but there should not be a limit to the percentage of international students. As an engineer, I would greatly appreciate full tuition because I suffer enough."
159,0,We practice institutional neutrality and signing it is hypocritical to that value.
160,1,"As it is, the compact does not affect Vanderbilt too much. Our international student population is below the 15% mark, it forces us to reinstitute our testing policy (which may have been done anyway soon), and freezing tuition increases is a positive for all students. Also if we were to somehow hit that endowment threshold soon then even better for students such as myself who are in the “hard sciences.” While I do very much disagree with the president of the United States meddling with the business of higher ed, I do believe that this compact AS IT IS NOW, does not infringe too much upon Vanderbilt’s independence."
161,0,"The compact has three insanely glaring problems around how it is written and what it is asking: (1) They are asking to screen every student and current students and use a ambigous, very vague ""anti-american bias"" as a key factor on deciding a student's academic capability --- frankly speaking, this is absurd, with such a vague definition most definitely being twisted to ""anyone who oposses Trump"" --- this is a massive overstep for putting down peaceful protest and dissent, (2) the part with “transform or abolish institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas"" is in absolute violation of the freedom of speech and the principle of neutrality and neutral political discourse Vanderbilt was founded on and continues to stand for --- my roomate is of an oppisite political opinion, while I trust him completely now after much time together --- I would not have been willing to being friends in the first place if it meant he could expulse me at any moment he wanted because of the more 'liberal-anti-conservative' things I say. (3) Finally, the sharing of sensitive student data is a violation of privacy and seems like it will only lead to increased government and federal survelience power. I see many of my friends voting yes simply because of the threats made by Trump and his administration --- with so much arbitrarily defined or not defined at all it is safe to say this is not a good idea."
162,0,It's not in Vanderbilts best interest to diverge from its previous statements on institutional neutrality which Deirmier so adamantly defended in the Bloomberg article. Signing a pact that punishes against outwards disgreement or bashing of conservative ideals is a violation of free speech and a controlling narrative thats concerning to consider being prevalent on a college campus built upon students and their voices. Some of the other ruling wouldn't have a vast effect on day to life except for the imposing restriction of free speech. that is ridiculous.
163,0,"I don't think that its the governments place to be involved in how the University decides to educate its students. I also don't believe in standardized testing. Furthermore I feel like our college campus is actucally a safe space to express ideas; there is bound to be disagreement and discourse amongst students and teachers shareing there politcile opinions but thats okay. I think the school does (and if not then it defintiely should) already have rules in place to protect people who want to share their political opinions be it conservative or liberal. So i don't think government involvement is necessary to reinforce that last clause. I sincerely hope that if the school denies this then government funding doesn't get cut, and the advantage of having priority in government funding certainly shouldn't be overlooked-- it comes down to principle, and I think this level of government involvement in the long term would not be what the school wants."
164,0,It shouldn’t matter what the benefits are - Vanderbilt could be handed $1 trillion on a silver platter and you have to say no. Accepting this contract sets a dangerous precedent of the President holding money over university’s heads to get what he wants. Universities are designed to be entities that act in the best interest of their students and the study of various fields. Agreeing to this would make Vanderbilt a laughing stock in the academic world.
165,1,"To be honest, I don’t see many negatives in the contract and we should prioritize keeping government funding"
166,0,It’s awful and directly contradicts everything Vanderbilt speaks for.
167,0,This compact is antagonistic to trans students. It represents government control over higher education.
168,0,To sign this contract would be to retract every statement claiming to side with “neutrality” as an institution.
169,0,"It goes against institutional neutrality, free speech, and creating a safe space on campus for all."
170,0,"As an institute of higher education there should be no limits to one’s thoughts and ability to learn what they desire to learn. This compact would only limit creativity, diverse thought, and innovation"
171,0,"This so called “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education” is absurd because it represents an alarming federal overreach into university governance, academic freedom, and personal rights. While framed as a path to “excellence,” the guidelines outlined would, in reality, dismantle many of the principles that make universities like Vanderbilt vibrant, inclusive, and intellectually rigorous. Mandating a tuition freeze without addressing inflation or operational costs would cripple resources for student support, faculty pay, and research. Forcing universities to define sex using narrow biological terms ignores modern science and the lived experiences of transgender and nonbinary students, creating an actively hostile environment. Limiting international enrollment to 15% undermines Vanderbilt’s global reputation and deprives students of essential cross-cultural learning. Moreover, banning consideration of race and gender in admissions or hiring would erase diversity efforts and perpetuate systemic inequities. Even more troubling, giving the Department of Justice oversight of campus “compliance” threatens free thought by policing ideas and departments that challenge conservative ideology. Education thrives on dialogue and dissent not government-enforced ideological conformity. This Compact is not about academic excellence, it is about political control, and its adoption would mark a chilling step away from the values of diversity, autonomy, and open inquiry that define higher education."
172,0,Government should not be able to change the curriculum of a private institution.
173,0,"Infringement of free speech and biased towards conservative ides, but I do like the idea of freezing tuition so the price of college doesn’t go up"
174,0,Don’t be a fascist
175,1,"I think the conditions are valid and will have a beneficial impact on Vanderbilt, although I would be cautious of what may come after this (in terms of future conditions that come with stipulations). If we agree to these conditions, it will be necessary to consider the implication that we will acquiesce to what he asks."
176,1,"Let's stop teaching falsified ideologies, start giving priority to American students, require merit based admission, and make college something worth going to again. There are only 2 genders and that is scientifically fact. American Citizens deserve to have more than international students. American Students after all are more likely to stay within our national economy after graduating. Race and sex should have nothing to do with college admission and shouldn't even be a question that plays a role in admissions. We can do all of this, the right thing, and make some money in doing so too. So why not?"
177,0,The government shouldn't have influence on the sexuality and gender of students.
178,0,The pact contradicts the core values that Vanderbilt prides itself on
179,0,"Regardless of my belief in any of the Compact guidelines, Vanderbilt is a private university and should not be in special agreements with the US government"
180,0,Overreach of executive authority on education
181,0,The fact that there’s two clauses about free speech is worrying. Having one about free speech generally and then one only focusing on conservatism presents a problematic dilemma that gives the government incentive to politicize schools in favor of their political policies.
182,0,Why would we want the DOJ to be able to watch more of our actions. This creates burden and prevents us from dating to grow
183,0,Its is private university.
184,0,I don't think we should sign the compact at all. It has unreasonable requests and restrictions that should not placed upon any school.
185,0,"The compact fails to highlight many discrepancies in educational standing. Bring back test scores though usually a good metric to determine student ability to succeed in college, puts a greater emphasis on that rather than what may have hindered them from obtaining a high enough score. In my opinion going test blind what the best thing a university could have done by looking at the students achievements and willpower to preserve in other aspects of their life. I am not going to go into other aspects of the compact as I believe it is already aware how terrible it is(cutting funding) but those are my main points"
186,0,Please no
187,0,It is insane to me that the federal government wants to control politics and ideas on campus. They will turn anything slightly against conservatives into their definition of violate or belittling to remove it from campus. College are a place of debate and knowledge for both sides.
188,0,"The university should maintain its independence as an institution separate from the federal government. Especially when this compact places restrictions on enrollment of international students and definitions of gender, which are reflective of the administration rather than the law, we need to maintain our ability to make these decisions as an institution."
189,0,"it’s harmful to not only students but the integrity of Vanderbilt as an institution. Vanderbilt’s motto is Dare to grow, this administration and contract contradicts what Vanderbilt stands for. This contract will not challenge us it will undermine Vanderbilt’s community restricting our ability to dare to grow."
190,0,This will devalue our education.
191,0,"A university should not subject itself to self-silencing criticism of an entire political side. While some of the aspects are appealing, the requirement that the school is not allowed to criticise conservative ideology is a mockery of free speech and will be used as a leverage to censor criticism towards the government, making the deal untenable. You should never sell out your political rights to whoever happens to be the highest bidder at that moment."
192,0,freedom of speech
193,1,It’s common sense
194,0,"This document is a clear tactic to advance a bogus political agenda by pairing it with reasonable or enticing measures. I would love to halt tuition each year and do believe there should be more transparency in admissions. But my own personal benefit is not worth the dangerous political precedent that will be set by allowing the White House to define and dictate what should be private institutional interests. In particular, the incredibly broad language in combating ""violence against conservative ideas"" is blatantly political and WILL be used to repress both science and good-faith freedom of speech as well as dangerous rhetoric."
195,0,We can’t compromise our values
196,0,"The compact is basically getting rid of the diversity that Vanderbilt so proudly praises itself on. By reducing the amount of foreign exchange students in the student visa program to a cap of 15% AND, “no more than 5% shall be from any one country,” you get less diversity and much less opportunity for the university to possibly have more astonishing students. In a way, it makes sense that the university would choose students with a higher family income, BUT that is NOT the only basis that they’re chosen from. ALSO, “to screen out students who demonstrate hostility to the United States,” is WILD. Categorizing these foreign students as possibly being hostile???? SO we’re gonna send ALL their information and their ENTIRE background to the Department of Homeland Security yeah that’s great and makes perfect sense. Have we had any national threats at Vanderbilt with admitting foreign exchange students??? BUT WAITTT, “any institution may maintain preferences in admissions for American citizens.” wow. I smell discrimination but idkkk. And saturating the campus with “anti-american values” hello? Where? If this is how the admissions process will be in the future, then all of these diverse minority groups will just continue to shrink and then how can this be a welcoming campus? How can you truly feel at home and feel like you belong in a place that has so few people similar to you? ALSOOOO drilling this idea of two genders is WILD. What would happen to the LGBTQ+ communities and students? This whole compact is targeting certain communities and “justifying” it in this flawed idea of “higher education.” Also categorizing degrees into this idea of “hard sciences,” is INCREDIBLY biased. Yes, there are difficult sciences, I’m a STEM student, BUT then that undermines the other majors that are so SIGNIFICANT and so IMPORTANT. They are all difficult in their own ways, and there is no means to categorize them as just broad as “hard” and “easy”. ALSO reducing the funding??? Vanderbilt is renowned in their research, in their LIFE SAVING research actually. This will affect every student on campus, especially the ones that this compact targets. I do not want to feel scared about my future because of things I can’t change about myself, and I know many other students feel the same. There's so many flaws and so many things wrong with this, and I hope the chancellor does NOT sign this, especially not as it currently stands."
197,0,"This would give the government way too much power over the university. I am particularly worried about what it means to ""punish"" departments against conservative ideas. That could mean anything that they want it to mean. This would have severe repercussions for everybody here. Also, wouldn't everyone just switch their major to a ""hard science""? This compact obviously wasn't written by anyone that has stepped foot on a college campus in the past 50 years. Like, Trump graduated college before my mom was born. That's wild!"
198,0,what the hell??
199,0,"If Vanderbilt is to truly be an institution conducive to hosting open, insightful dialogue and civil discourse, as is promised to us relentlessly from the moment we enroll to the moment we graduate, they will not sign this Compact as-is, or in any revised format. The foundation of strong civil discourse and exchange relies on the free exchange of contrasting ideas: this includes scholarship, research, and opinions that ""belittle"" conservative ideas. Signing this contract would be shameful for a multitude of reasons, but foremost it would be a revocation of what this university stands for above all, and that is unfettered free speech."
200,0,"I say this as a republican, who wants less government interference in my country. Tuition freezing and less money from full paying international students could lead to less income for the university itself, which scares me. Also, especially as a private university, those types of decisions should be solely up to us. We will become more reliant on the deal and holding on for dear life to government funding. That gives excess power to the DOJ and government. Does that potential not scare you a little bit? Also, DEI is a legal thing now. It’s separate from this."
201,0,Policies go against what Vanderbilt's values stand for
202,0,my major and field of study is strongly supported why one political side. as an environmental science major and sociology major my class discussion center on the fact that these field are real and impact our world. I do not want to spend my classes trying to prove that my field of study is real and relevant rather than discussing real solutions and how we can make our world better.
203,0,"I agree with Vanderbilt’s Democratic Council in the argument that a lot of components of the Compact sound very attractive (notably the tuition freeze), but added commentary on the limitation of conservative attacking throughout campus is overly specific and evidently inserted without regard to liberal, democratic, or general protection of other forms of communication or expression in the face of physical violence or danger. Because of this, I don’t disagree that this Compact is an underlined test to Vanderbilt’s Neutrality Principle which was one of the most direct features of the school I chose such for, and I do think signing this compact with priority to additional federal funding would diminish both the literal basis and the conversations, interactions, and literal existence of many organizations in Vanderbilt (Discussions Vanderbilt, ex.) that the school had stood upon for more than a century."
204,0,Vanderbilt should remain free from federal policing of higher education and protect itself and other institutions from future encroachment and interference.
205,0,"What makes Vanderbilt such a lovely place to be are the diverse voices that are present. By signing as is, I think a lot of us would question Vanderbilt’s integrity."
206,0,"I think that some of the ideas outlined in the document are in line with Vanderbilt's vision for higher education. However, I think it's still concerningly vague about what the consequences for how. Also think that there are some clauses that do not align with Vanderbilt's vision and or could potentially harm the university as an institution. I'm not completely against the signing of this document in the future, provided some of the clauses are reworked, however, I think it is important that the current version of the compact is not signed as is."
207,0,"This agreement only lasts five years and may bring some short-term benefits. As a university, we should take a longer-term view. Does signing it amount to taking a political side? And when a new administration comes in after those five years, how should Vanderbilt position itself?"
208,1,This will incentivise universities to become areas of free speech and provide greater human capital for the United States. This also provides for fairer admission standards
209,0,"As a transgender student, I would feel incredibly unsafe, betrayed, and disappointed if Vanderbilt were to sign this contract. This decision would impact my rights to life, liberty, and happiness and impact my housing, how I use the bathroom, and how I access healthcare on campus. I think signage of this contract would be a direct betrayal of Vanderbilt's integrity and their promise of institutional neutrality. I, and many of my fellow students, would see the decision to agree to this contract as a shameful one."
210,0,Education is separate from the federal government period
211,0,This compact is designed to infringe on institutional neutrality and is antithetical to everything Vanderbilt believes itself to be.
212,0,"I do not believe Vanderbilt should sign the Compact. Our university’s strength lies in its diversity of thought, background, and experience, values that have always pushed us to think critically and empathetically. The proposed restrictions, such as limits on international students and prohibitions on considering race or gender, would make our community less inclusive and less reflective of the world we hope to lead. I’m also concerned about the broader implications for academic freedom and open expression. Policies that tie funding to political definitions or restrict institutional speech risk creating an environment of self-censorship rather than open inquiry. Vanderbilt’s greatness comes from its ability to bring together people with different perspectives and allow honest, respectful debate. The Compact, as written, would threaten that core strength."
213,1,We would benefit As university to have smart students tuition payed for and benefit from domestic students helping the country in the future
214,0,Definitely not
215,0,The federal government should not limit expression of anti-conservative ideals on the campus of a private institution.
216,0,"It is foolish to base admission on most standard tests. Also, disruptions in class can be a form of free speech and any policy that goes against that should be very carefully worded. The conservative views part is entirely unnecessary and a severe overreach. The others are mostly acceptable."
217,0,"The contract opposes everything Vanderbilt stands for. A big draw to Vanderbilt is the diversity, which creates a thriving community of diverse opinions. We can learn so much from each other, and, as we have learned in Dialogue Vanderbilt, it is important to respect each other and learn. Signing the compact would take away a unique part of the Vanderbilt experience."
218,0,"violates institutional neutrality, which goes against Vanderbilt"
219,0,"As a female engineer, I think they should still strive to make engineering 50-50 women to men. I came to Vanderbilt because of their commitment to women in engineering."
220,0,"Despite my agreement with some of the rationale here, the terms are extremely vague and undefined which is very dangerous. I think it would be in Vanderbilts best interest to lock arms with the other universities to at the minimum clarify what’s being asked for. The danger here is retaliation against the whole group. If that risk is deemed to be too material, we are forced to sign."
221,0,"Regardless of whether or not I agree with the changes that the Trump administration is posing, there is no place in America for the White House to attach federal funding required for necessary, life-saving research to political ideology. Federal funds required for clinical trials and research should not be used as leverage in a battle of political ideologies."
222,0,It is way too vague and opens Vanderbilt up to political reprisal based on arbitrary determinations that may change at any given time.
223,1,"I think it will make admissions more fair! I am also very sick of professors being so biased talking badly about the conservative party even thought we are a neutral campus. I feel as thought a lot of neutrality is already similar to what the compact states so I think it will be more beneficial. In addition, many people are arguing that individuals who are transgender or in the process won't be allowed to use the bathroom. However, Vanderbilt has many gender neutral bathrooms for this reason so the compact would not change much. Lastly, a lot of people are shying away from majoring in political science because professors tend to be more biased so I hope that with this compact, more people will feel comfortable majoring in something they truly have a passion for. ."
224,0,The compact is entirely against all of Vanderbilt's values as an institution.
225,0,"worried about disability rights on campus and how vague the compact is (slippery slope). I think vanderbilt's supportive community makes it unique, and this would increase the feelings of hostility. I do like some parts of it (tuition for hard sciences, transparency in metrics, free speech - but I think Vandy already does this)"
226,0,Would be unfair to education majors and students studying liberal arts. Also allows government interference in private affairs and would lead to a loss of Vanderbilt as an institution instead of a tool of Trump’s regime. The tuition benefit is just to hook students it does not have the universities overall best interest in mind.
227,0,I don't like Trump or any of his policies. I have great pride in the school that I attend and to see its federal funding being controlled by someone who obviously does not value research or the furthering of educational knowledge.
228,0,It is terrible and disgusting.
229,0,Do not give into clearly partisan tactics. Retain our commitment to institutional neutrality.
230,0,"This is anti-constitutional and terrifying for our university, the values we are giving up would defeat our purpose of institutional neutrality."
231,0,"A university should not accept bribes in exchange for supporting a certain political agenda, especially as a research institution because it impacts the integrity of the scientific discoveries the university makes."
232,0,The government is currently radically right. To agree with them breaks the supposed neutrality held by Vanderbilt. Even inspite of the federal funding being held for coercion.
233,0,"If any of these things were true the day I applied to Vanderbilt, then I would not have gotten in. I'm very thankful to be a student at Vanderbilt University, and I think it's quite cretinous to apply such expectations to a private university."
234,0,I don’t think it allows us to continue a position of neutrality
235,0,A President should not have power over what universities teach. Universities should be the most powerful voices against a President who is overreaching his power.
236,0,"While I would love a tuition freeze, I feel as though many of the guidelines can be used to limit free speech. While the document claims personal free speech is aloud, so much of the student voice is supported through departments, the departmental limitations would effectively bar this form of free speech."
237,0,I think this is a disgusting manipulation of our higher education system to further us towards authoritarianism and I would hope that a leader in the higher ed world wouldn't succumb to this. Especially considering Vanderbilt already offers incredible financial aid packages and has one of the nations largest endowments. I would be ashamed as a student and alumni if Vandy signed the compact. How we as a community align ourselves will set a standard and sway our counterparts please make me a proud commodore.
238,0,"Signing this compact would remove the safety's given to students of color, trans students, and financially underprivileged students. Moreover, this continues to place higher values on STEM fields (or whatever ""hard sciences"" means) rather than our just as important humanities departments. The Vanderbilt Peabody College of Education and Human Development is THE top education school in the country, and yet receives little attention from the university, or this compact for that matter. Why not give them tuition waivers? Overall, this poses to harm Vanderbilt's diverse community and keep its overly unattainable elitist status, and leaves the rest of us to rot."
239,0,The compact undermines student identities and is not in line with out university’s value or Diermeir’s principled neutrality-signing it as it is would be a clearly politically charged action.
240,0,"Some of the points on the compact are beneficial, preferential, even; however, Vanderbilt should not willingly submit to the Trump administration and sacrifice its institutional and educational freedom for funding money, especially as part of it will require Vanderbilt to assume positions on student identity and freedom of thought that are antithetical to Vanderbilt’s mission. Vanderbilt should chose to dare to grow, but not through signing a Faustian bargain."
241,1,Tuition freeze
242,0,Essentially a bribe.
243,0,"I don’t think that some agreement with the government for the basis of funding is a good idea. Rather, congress should approve funding for schools, and if they do not like how some aspects of universities are run, laws should be enacted (as was shown by the Supreme Court ruling against affirmative action). There is no reason to negotiate directly with executive branch to decide these things. I don’t think they should sign any agreement, either the government passes a law or it doesn’t."
244,1,I like more funding
245,0,"This is a massive overstep of this Administration, which I would say is moving toward Fascism. This is their attempt to silence those who disagree with them, which is unconstitutional and unacceptable. We should not sign this compact if we value freedom of speech, press, expression or any other constitutional freedoms."
246,0,This compact is a fascist attempt from the Trump Administration to censor free speech on campus and further harm our international/queer/POC and other marginalized communities on campus. The federal government has no business in restricting free speech on campus and aligning ourselves with the compact would be allowing for a gross overstepping of the government. I would be disgusted to call myself a member of Vanderbilt University if we bow down to this harmful rhetoric.
247,0,"It’s contradictory. Protect free speech, but also reform units that disagree with conservative views? Removal of DEI?"
248,0,"Vanderbilt’s strength rests on inclusive excellence and the vigorous exchange of ideas. Imposing a strict cap on international student enrollment—especially at such a low percentage—risks constraining the very intellectual diversity and civil discourse that animate our campus. To sustain a community enriched by a broad range of perspectives and knowledge systems, Vanderbilt should remove such caps and maintain a holistic, country-agnostic admissions approach that welcomes talented students from all nations. Removing race- and gender-conscious approaches from admissions and hiring risks narrowing the university’s capacity to identify promising talent that has been historically unseen, under-resourced, or structurally excluded. A great research university thrives when it gathers people whose perspectives have been shaped by different histories, neighborhoods, and educational pathways; absent intentional attention to equity, many of those voices never make it to the table. Vanderbilt should keep these policies of admissions and employment to keep these chances. Taking punitive action against departments for holding views perceived as inconsistent with conservative ideals and enforcing protest restrictions that curtail students’ ability to express dissent risks undermining core principles of free expression and academic freedom. Such measures edge toward illiberal control rather than open inquiry, narrowing the range of debate precisely where universities should cultivate good-faith disagreement. Vanderbilt, as well as its staff and students, should be given free will to take a side on certain issues. Accordingly, I urge Vanderbilt to advocate forcefully for revisions that advance the interests of students and faculty—or, failing that, to withhold its signature."
249,0,"I do not believe in limiting international student admissions or providing hard sciences tuition breaks, and the wording around departments belittling conservative ideas is vague and could be misinterpreted."
250,0,"I don't agree with limiting free speech and defining sex. In addition, I think there should be more clarfication regarding ""Universities must reform or remove units that “'punish, belittle, or incite violence against conservative ideas.'"""
251,0,"The compact's clear intention is to reduce the number of international students as well as the diversity of our student body with respect to race, ethnicity, gender, and other markers of identity. This opposes Vanderbilt's mission to encourage diverse ideas that come from different perspectives and lived experiences. It seems straightforward to me that the compact does not align with this value, which is important not only for the cultivation of a liberal arts environment but also for creative and innovative advancement in Vanderbilt's research and development interests. Additionally, the compact's aim to protect conservative free speech is simply a less effective way of trying to accomplish what Vanderbilt is already surprisingly good at. I have been impressed by the existence of a true culture of free speech at this university which is lacking in much of American higher education. Space is made for, and respect given to, conservative opinions expressed at this institution, and I don't think we need ""help"" in that regard from the Trump administration."
252,0,"Vanderbilt already has a strong commitment to institutional neutrality, and has strong ties with donors and adequate funding to defend themselves and sustain growth. Identities should not be surprised, and ideologies should not be particularly supported. The compact explicitly expressed the obligation to uplift far right voices and surpress valid identities."
253,0,Trump has proven time and time again he does not care about education or any forms of educational development. Signing this is a death warrant to Vanderbilt. If we want to protect education not only in Vanderbilt but this country; WE MUST NOT SIGN IT.
254,1,Vanderbilt benefits from the federal government thus it is beholden to its standards
255,0,"I believe some aspects of the compact will be benefical, such as  freezing tuition rates. However, many other aspects I am worried about, such as what taking action against departments deemed unwelcome to conservative thought might look like. I also request many, many more details as the implementation of such measures greatly impacts whether Vanderbilt should sign the Compact."
256,0,"This is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to push a specific ideology upon colleges and universities. This time around its just worded a little nicer compared to what Columbia and Harvard got. As it stands, republican, conservative, and right leaning views aren’t noticeably suppressed or belittled, let alone punished. The end goal of this whole thing is the suppression and eventual elimination of all views that aren’t aligned with the far-right views of the current administration. Even if Vanderbilt signs this, it is inevitable that they will come back with another, stricter compact. This certainly does’t make Vanderbilt immune from lawsuits or other such actions from this administration. The other important thing to remember is that this administration will eventually no longer be in power. At that point any benefit gained by playing along will be outweighed by the damage to Vanderbilt’s reputation as a politically independent institution that upholds freedom of speech and expression for students and staff alike. In short, don’t give into these demands as they will only hurt Vanderbilt."
257,0,"Equality in Admissions already exists, affirmative action was struck down by the Supreme Court. Generally, It is impossible to stay neutral as an institution while also ""appeasing to conservative ideas and ideals"" both for gender-as-sex ideology and ""departments that punish, belittle, or incite violence against conservatives."" The most important word in that phrase is ""belittle-->"" whatever counts as belittling can not be determined by a court or jury, and puts minorities with non-conservative views at risk. If someone's feelings are hurt after an open debate and they report it as ""conservative belittling,"" would the student who shared their opposing views be punished? Generally, this document is too broad and nondescript to be signed, and allows people who disagree with the Trump administration to be at risk on campus."
258,1,I think we should negotiate some aspects in order to get some federal funding back.
259,0,One of the points on the contract is to get rid of free speech (being unable to criticize conservatives) and its weird in general
260,0,"While many sections of the Compact may appear principled, such as “Equality in Admissions” and “Student Equality”, they are, in reality, destructive and disadvantageous to Vanderbilt students. Prohibiting consideration of race, ethnicity, and other identity factors in admissions blatantly ignores the historical and structural inequities that persist today. Additionally, defining gender solely in terms of “reproductive function and biological processes” erases and invalidates the identities of students who do not align with their assigned gender or with binary gender categories. Additionally, the Compact’s insistence on impartial protection of conservative views risks privileges certain ideologies and suppressing open dialogue. Therefore, President Trump’s Contract threatens the values of inclusion, intellectual freedom, and equity that Vanderbilt strives to uphold."
261,0,"We should not give in to the demands of dictatorship! As a stand-out university, we should be LEADERS and respectfully decline this pact, leaning on our alumni, students, and staff and setting a trend for just, righteous, and critically aware university affiliates to follow."
262,0,"Trump is a disgusting president who is trying to force his dated-beliefs onto Vanderbilt. There should be a separation of the government from this private institution and he is using funding as his leverage. As Vanderbilt has copious funds and alumni contributions, we should dip into those funds instead of relying on the government. I would be truly beyond disappointed if Vanderbilt signed this Compact."
263,0,"Signing this compact means complying with a President who is a convicted felon and an administration that actively infringes not only on the Constitution, but the rights of citizens, especially racial and sexual minorities. Although it may bring short-term benefits, the lasting impact on the culture of free speech and advocacy that Vanderbilt is proud to have right now will be devastating. The legacy of Vanderbilt as an institution, as well as those who are in power, will be forever marred by the fact that they did not choose to stand for their students or for their values that they proclaim. Do not sign the compact."
264,1,"I see no reason as to why these things are bad. Race and gender should have been long removed from admissions and employment. Even if the university ""says"" they comply, I'm glad they will actually be held accountable. It's about time that tuition be taken care of and conservative ideas be respected. Vanderbilt would do themselves a big favor by signing the Compact."
265,0,Sparking violence because of political opinions is crazy in a country built on free speech. Seems like a roundabout way to push for whiter institutions
266,1,"Vanderbilt is already in compliance with the majority of the Compact, and the remaining provisions are frankly quite reasonable. Additionally, from a pragmatic non-ideological and non-idealistic perspective, the University should be pursuing a path that guarantees its survival, not one that will lead to financial ruin and further closing of academic programs as witnessed at other institutions."
267,0,"It is my opinion that the Trump administration presented this compact to Vanderbilt because at key junctures over the last few years, such as the protests at Kirkland in 2023 and the removal of diversity, equity, and inclusion resources, when presented with a choice between standing for free speech and an open community or acquiescing to the right, Chancellor Diermeier has at every turn chosen to make a mockery of ""principled neutrality"" and emasculate this university. Diermeier should take this opportunity to do the right thing and regain some respect among the student body and reject this Faustian deal."
268,0,I think restrictions on international student population and genders will foster a community of exclusions and oppression.
269,0,"I think while there are certain aspects of the compact that could be beneficial to current students and future applicants, the compact proposes a direct threat to one of our main values as an institution. Chancellor Diermeier has on many occasions stated his commitment to institutional neutrality and I believe that while signing the compact would ensure our funding (for the time being) it would also directly contradict one of our institutions highly important values. Signing the compact will ultimately not end up securing funding for the university long-term. It will however, put students and faculty in a position where they feel less inclined to exercise their right to free speech and make this institution not an independent one, but one legally bound to the government. How can we educate students to respect differing views and neutrality if the institution itself does not practice the neutrality it so highly speaks of?"
270,0,"This compact is so obviously a direct threat to the freedoms students and higher education institutions. Vanderbilt will be a less safe. Less people will be allowed to come here, let alone WANT to be here. Less opportunities will exist. Less people will be given the chance to dare to grow (a slogan I think is already naive in its belief that students here currently get such opportunities). This compact is about control and surveillance. Vanderbilt is a private institution. The school’s decision will break its commitment to “principled neutrality” either way, an unrealistic commitment in the first place. Should Vanderbilt agree to this compact, it will become a lesser institution."
271,0,"We should not change campus culture and impact marginalized groups just for money. Additionally, conservatives are not the silent majority and already control many of our systems, but it’s also just a violation of the first amendment they preach about to silence people for not liking ideas. These ideas themselves are also just harmful to multiple groups of people and is not going to be a long-term benefit."
272,1,It is way better
273,1,"Vanderbilt already meets most of the requirements in this compact (international student population is under 15% and we do not have over $2 million per student endowment, for example) and signing it would not cause significant change. Additionally, Vanderbilt already complies with many federal policies to receive federal funding - this is well precedented."
274,0,The section allowing punishment for anti conservatism crosses the line of freedom of speech too much. Allowing the government (which is extremely conservative) have the ability to deem ideas as anti conservative and have the power to punish such ideas is a facist ideal. Moreover capping international students would limit funding for student aid and take away a lot of money from the university. Overall the compact is scary and should be turned away if Vanderbilt truly believes in institutional neutrality.
275,0,It blatantly disregards Vanderbilts motto of “Institutional Neutrality”
276,0,"This is insane!! From what I gathered, if Vanderbilt signs the Compact, our individuality is essentially being striped away."
277,0,"This goes against everything that we claim to stand for: neutrality, a campus that fosters growth, a diverse and welcoming place to learn. If Vanderbilt cares at all about the students over its funding, which we were doing great before this pact to begin with, then they will not agree to this."
278,0,"I don’t like that the government is weighing into the administration of a private university. While I agree with some of the statements in the document, I don’t appreciate the larger issue it represents. Additionally, many of the requirements of this compact are extremely vague, and I worry how the interpretation from the federal government will differ from what is initially expected."
279,0,Do not be intimidated and subjected to a higher power.
280,0,"Compact reduces gender to sex, ignoring legitimate scholarship in gender studies and other social sciences in favor of Trump's ideological agenda. This is a violation of free speech; people should be free to express their views and research on these subjects in academia. I also take issue with this hard science favoritism, as if the humanities are less important, though that's not a major issue. Also, the terminology used in the compact is quite vague and can easily be taken advantage of."
281,0,"The compact is biased against students of color, LGBTQ+ students, and students studying the arts and humanities. ""Protecting free speech"" and ""preserving conservative ideals"" could mean the destruction of any speech that supports students in the groups mentioned above. I also believe that signing this compact would violate Vanderbilt's neutrality policy."
282,0,"Disagree with last line about limiting critiques of conservative viewpoints, most others I agree with (maybe not the assigning gender terms one either)."
283,0,"The clause about anti-conservative rights is too vague, and this administration would use it to hurt vulnerable students."
284,0,I fear that signing the Compact would harm many of the diversity and inclusivity we have on campus and drastically impact student resources.
285,0,Violates inclusivity factor
286,0,"I am incredibly disappointed that Vanderbilt is even considering signing this compact. By signing, Vanderbilt would essentially surrender our freedom of speech and kowtow to a racist and corrupt administration."
287,0,"We are a private institution and it is our right to decide how to govern some of our policies. If we let the government dictate these agreements now, they can hold over our funding for the long term. Look at Columbia for example."
288,0,"I think that most problems the compact tries to address are legitimate; however, I'm worried by the current phrasing of the compact around political protections. Instead of turning this down completely, can we please talk to the White House about reaching a more neutral agreement while still securing the funds that Vanderbilt really needs as well as combating things like tuition increases, grade inflation, and concerns about free speech from all sides? It's not like Vanderbilt hasn't accepted federal funding before..."
289,0,"I think that international diversity is such a large part of what makes Vanderbilt, Vanderbilt!"
290,0,"Taking action against departments that ""belittle conservative ideas"" goes against Vanderbilt's core values of institutional neutrality. I would be ashamed to still attend this university if Vanderbilt decides to abandon its values and accept this bribe from the Trump administration."
291,0,It would sell out the student body and faculty who actually champion diversity of identity and perspectives. Why should the president decide what I’m allowed to learn he doesn’t pay my tuition.
292,0,"This document is a violation of free speech; promotes limited binary perspective on gender, and attempts to push a conservative agenda that punishes any member who disagrees with Trump’s authoritarian regime."
293,0,"This compact has language that would further perpetuate harm against our international students/alum has been facing, along with targeting several other groups. It is a fascist attempt at censoring free speech on campus and would force Vanderbilt to align with the Trump Administration."
294,0,"""Departments that target conservative views: Universities must reform or remove units that “punish, belittle, or incite violence against conservative ideas,” while still enforcing rules against harassment and incitement."" This is completely against freedom of speech. This would honestly be a horrible choice for the institution"
295,0,"Very one-sided and limits institututional freedoms, and by extension, students' individual liberties"
296,0,The government should not dictate university policies. Student freedoms should be protected.
297,1,"Accessibility is the core principle of Vanderbilts experience. Cost is the number one driver of college decisions. The tuition freeze outlined in the plan allows more students to be able to commit to a Vanderbilt education, at a reasonable price. The tuition increases in the past have been extreme, and will only continue."
298,0,"I personally believe that we must reject this compact in any form, and that no amount of negotiations will yield a product that doesn’t violate our core principles."
299,0,It’s not representative of our schools values as a whole and doesn’t all for free speech and ideas.
300,0,"Capping International student's enrollment just because Trump is racist seems quite ridiculous for our institution to do. At least a third of our student body is international, Vanderbilt would fall in ranking without international students. I doubt Diermier really wants that. Additionally, we all know that if we accept this we will be controlled by Trump and his politicals. By accepting this, we are taking a stance. We claim to not be, but by doing this we through diversity out the window and go full in on conservative ideals. Through being independent and safe at Vanderbilt out the window, welcome to Republican world."
301,0,"So many professors would quit due to the restraints on what they would be able to teach, which would not be good for our university’s reputation. We shouldn’t be selling outs."
302,0,Limiting international students seems xenophobic; whole compact is biased towards conservative ideals; restrictions on gender; unnecessary government intervention in university affairs
303,0,"The compact caps international student enrollment, and orders the university to follow strict definitions that curtail civil rights. It is a blatant overreach of federal power and makes the Trump administration judge, jury, and executioner for what is deemed acceptable at Vanderbilt."
304,0,Counter
305,0,Should not be conforming because of the pressure of any president
306,1,TRUMPPPP
307,1,All 10 points are great and will help Vanderbilt be the college all other universities should strive to be.
308,0,"This compact is disguising pushing ideals of the Trump administration with language about students rights and neutrality. I fear that this act would allow the administration to shut down valuable classes and departments that provide genuine help to students on our campus, making them feel more included, such as the department of Gender and Sexuality Studies. Additionally, it should be noted that in Biology classes, we are taught the process of human development and fetal development and it is never stated that there are biologically more than one two genders. I'm not sure why they are making it seem like this is not the case. I fear that signing this compact would put us as an institution at the mercy of the Trump administration, and it will create harmful barriers and rhetoric towards certain minority groups here on campus, such as the LGBTQ+ community and international students."
309,0,trump sucks and is actually bonkers; vanderbilt has a deep history with inclusion and international students and would be insane to sign this
310,0,"The section of “purposefully punish, belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas.” violates Vanderbilt's policy of institutional neutrality."
311,0,This would devalue my education.
312,0,"Signing the contract in my opinion is just a sign of complicity. The demands/requirements from the trump administration won’t stop changing and becoming more oppressive, and by signing it, we’re acquiescing to the Trump administrations demands now and in the future."
313,0,"Academic freedom should not be compromised with compliance to a specific set of political ideals. The financial benefits of this compact coming at the expense of reinforcement of conservative beliefs is a clear breach of Vanderbilt’s pride of social integrity, to which signing this compact would give unorthodox preference to the Trump Administration’s policies. In accordance to Vanderbilt’s Community Creed, we must not give into this perversion of our commitment to equity and personal freedom."
314,1,"I 100% agree with the idea that by including race or gender quotas in the admission process, we contradict the fact that merit and character should be the primary considerations in getting into Vanderbilt. I would also like to know what the Trump administration will define as ""hard sciences""."
315,0,Say no to trumps fascist ideology!
316,0,Signing it would be the opposite of institutionally neutral
317,0,needs revisions
318,1,It offers free tuition to any hard science majors which would be a huge help to me and my family
319,0,I’m an international student
320,0,It goes against much of what Vanderbilt has worked towards for years. What is the point of a university that signs this compact? It is despicable to even consider it.
321,0,"While some things may be beneficial, many take away from our free speech, opinions, and identities."
322,0,An overreach of the government in our private institution. Agree with some things but not others and not the principle of what it means to sign something like this.
323,0,"I believe that this goes against our said freedoms. These guidelines are actively restricting people from freedom of expression and you cannot impose unfair rules that make our university’s environment more difficult than it already is. They are taking away our diversity in the school as well and imposing beliefs that not everyone believes in, nor should they have to believe in. This will only cause more harm to the students and their futures. If Vanderbilt is really a school that welcomes a curious and diverse environment, why would we ever sign a document that calls for a conformist and uniform environment?"
324,0,Fascism has no place at Vanderbilt
325,0,"Limiting free speech, international limit wouldn’t effect us, don’t meet “hard science” cut off so that won’t help students"
326,1,I support the president
327,0,"If Diermeier is as intent on protecting political discourse and maintaining principled neutrality, agreeing to this compact would be wholly against his core values. Regardless of political affiliation, uplifting one-sided ideas in return for more money is wrong! Vanderbilt also prides itself on being a beacon for global-mindedness. What kind of message would it send if we agree to limit the opportunities of people from across the world who are well-qualified to earn an education at a top-tier university? Not only should we not sign this compact, but the students and those affiliated with Vanderbilt deserve a statement or a comment from Diermeier - whatever decision he makes."
328,0,"I believe that by accepting and signing this compact, Vanderbilt has done a disservice to the body of students it has declared it is representative of. Capping international student admissions at 15% is not only an outspoken stance against their place in this institution, but a discrimination against a large percentage of the student body that represents Vanderbilt now and in the past. Regardless of the amount of international students we admit to this day, placing a cap on their ability to succeed in the admissions process is in complete contradiction of the holistic approach that Vanderbilt claims to take when making admissions decisions. In regard to adhering to the strict definitions of gender, I believe that Vanderbilt faces not only backlash but a large percentage of the student body who will feel uncomfortable and unsafe at this institution."
329,0,"I do not believe that the federal government should have sway over universities regardless of whether the policies are to the right, left, or anywhere in between"
330,0,trump wants higher education to lose diversity and to turn this country back to pre-segregation era. Vanderbilt should never bow down to the trump administration.
331,0,Why are we willing to fold and give into the federal government now. What happened to the acclaimed principled neutrality? There is nothing neutral about this- it is undeniably promoting a single political ideology.
332,0,"While I would love tuition to be frozen for the next 5 years, I do not like the idea of being put under a regulation that can infringe upon our ability to criticize the governments future actions. These so called “benefits” are ultimately a way to sway the audience in the favor of the compact - and I do not agree with such ideals."
333,0,Absolutely not. Violating our Student Handbook is already a huge red flag. Tying university policies in a legal agreement that simply serves a political agenda is interference from the government at an unprecedented level. The government should not be leveraging federal funding to gain control and oversight over private institutions as this is extremely concerning.
334,1,"I don’t see many ways which this changes the current stance of the university. One that may go against typical stances is the gender statement. Though this may be a change in typical stance of most students, we are a research and science university. If we cannot accept the scientific fact that women are women and men are men then we go against our identity as a university. Identifying and claiming to be may be two different things. A woman being a biological woman and an identified woman being someone who was uncomfortable with a prior title they had."
335,0,"Although students may agree with some of the points, I disagree with permitting government involvement in the workings of private institutions and professors to such a degree; I also disagree with the demands to ""screen out students who demonstrate hostility to the United States, its allies, or its values"" and define gender categories based on reproductive criteria."
336,0,"This compact is the complete opposite of human rights. Removing our freedom of speech, education, college affordability, and unity rights."
337,0,"Allowing/forcing Vanderbilt to hire off of people’s political views compromises the values of higher education. Additionally, the language on abolishing clubs that challenge republican ideologies goes against free speech, and I would not be proud to go to an institution that pushes for that."
338,0,One of Vanderbilt’s core appeals is how diversifying the courses are. They not only engage students but challenge them to think beyond their personal scopes and outside their comfort zones. How can the university pride its self on being well rounded if its strips the core aspect of what feed this notion.
339,0,We should not succumb to this administration
340,1,"1 - In light of the Charlie Kirk passing, I think it is important that an educational institution should dedicate necessary resources to ensure free speech. 2 - Preventing the costs of college from rising significantly while being more transparent about their data will always be positive. We should already have this data in the first place. 3 - There should already be no race/sex discrimination when hiring and Universities should all be politically neutral."
341,0,"The wording surrounding ""belittling conservative ideas"" is very ambiguous and would give the government unprecedented oversight over the university. This compact clearly favors one ideological stance and  directly opposes our policy to maintain institutional neutrality."
342,0,"We cannot have justice department oversight over whether institutions are meeting the restrictions on free speech of faculty members as defined by the presidential administration. We cannot threaten students’ rights to assemble simply because it goes against the government’s interests. The Compact’s implicit threat to remove funding at any time for noncompliance after universities sign is inherently unconstitutional as per the conditions doctrine, and Vanderbilt should not legitimize this Compact with a signature."
343,0,"Trump is a fascist. Fascists are evil. Bending the knee to fascists is a terrible and weak thing to do. Furthermore, bending the knee to fascism erodes the “principled neutrality” Chancellor Diermeier claimed to cherish. If Chancellor Diermeier wants Vanderbilt students to respect him at all he will give the Trump regime the legal/political equivalent of a middle finger."
344,0,We should not be limiting enrollment of international students.
345,0,"I believe that the compact infringes on academic independence and also violates our adherence to neutrality. Not only does it harm international students and other marginalized communities but the free speech of the students in general, which in turn affects the way ideas are born and shared in our compus. Additionally, the compact itself is too vague, what in their eyes does it mean to ""belittle"" conservative ideas, and in turn, what would this punishment look like? This institution is a hub of innovation and research due to the range of experiences, mutual engagement in critical thinking, collaboration, free dialogue and inquiry we are able to partake in, is it worth killing these concepts that set us part from other institutions in favor of preferential access to federal grants?"
346,0,"As an African American female student of Vanderbilt university, I know how much race and gender have impact my life everyday. I believe moments of trauma, bias, and oppression should be considered in admissions!"
347,0,"This compact limits the freedoms of university affiliated individuals, perpetuates reductive perspectives on the lives and experiences of students and staff, and creates even greater barriers for students who are already disadvantaged or marginalized by already existing contexts"
348,0,"I think some of the regulations in the compact are positive and some are negative. Regardless, I do not believe that Vanderbilt should be beholden to the whims of the government in such a manner. Submitting to specific rules in exchange for preferential treatment feels morally reprehensible at face value. I believe this administration does not share Vanderbilt's belief in the value of higher education, the value of dialogue, and critical thinking. I believe this contract does not align with Vanderbilt's position of principled neutrality. I also fear the implications this contract may have on the administration's ability to interfere with Vanderbilt's activity further down the line. Who knows what kind of justification this would offer for investigation and interference? Who knows how partisan the next version of the contract will be? I strongly urge Vanderbilt to stand up for the independence of universities, and to reject what is essentially a bribe for compliance. We should not operate in fear of retaliation."
349,0,This is ridiculous
350,0,I see this compact as just one of the many overreaches of this administration. Universities must remain independent as they are needed as the producers of free thought and innovation. To submit to this Compact would completely surrender that privilege.
351,0,"Scary to give him the power to make these decisions based on his opinion. Purposely vague in order to get universities to sign, good idea in theory but will be executed poorly."
352,0,Restriction on education is the first step towards authoritarianism
353,0,"This compact will be absolutely destructive to free speech. How can a university claim to be neutral if they sign a pact with a clear political agenda to discriminate against already-vulnerable minority groups? Cutting back international acceptance rates will weaken our ability approach complex issues in policy and healthcare from various angles, and putting protection on *only* conservative speech is exactly how a majority silences opposition in order to control dissent. This compact is not about academic integrity. It is about ending the ability of promising young thinkers to visualize change and enforcing old, stale ideas upon them. The university should improve dialogue programs instead of agreeing to vague guidelines that threaten our ideal of daring to grow."
354,0,The long-term good is the short-term good. Always.
355,0,"I think a lot of the proposals are good, but I don’t agree with capping the international enrollment at 15%"
356,0,Some of the clauses are reasonable but some of them are so unreasonable that it makes the entire thing atrocious. The tuition hold is a great idea but some of them are terrible.
357,0,"“Take action against department which “Purposely punish” belittle, and even spark violence against conservative ideas” defeats the purpose of the first amendment. Chancellor Diermier expressed that Vanderbilt doesn’t choose a side, we all have our ideas and beliefs within the campus. With this compact being signed we move away from this truth Vanderbilt stands for."
358,0,I think its for the best of colleges to remain free and independent of political overreach by the government
359,1,"Tuition is rapidly rising each year for several top universities, freezing this helps relieve monetary stress on students. Due to certain events, protecting individual voice is necessary. By removing provisions that may make admissions less objective and standardized, we can embrace individual merit."
360,0,"This compact serves to restrict freedom of speech through the protection of some beliefs. If we want to be able to have open discourse and build civility and a strong community, we have to have free speech protected to the fullest extent. This compact stifles first amendment rights - instead of restricting what people say, we must focus on how to disagree and cool temperatures during discussions."
361,0,"I think none of the universities should sign the compact on principle. Such a close intervention by the federal government into universities is a very dangerous precedent to set. I am not against all parts of the compact, but restrictions on protests and political expression particularly worry me. However, I am concerned that losing access to preferential funding will irreparably damage Vanderbilt University."
362,0,I disagree it goes against the basis of meritocracy in regards to capping international students. Also the language is vague enough for people to interpret and leverage in not nice ways.
363,0,Don’t take the money that gives too much power to the government
364,0,"We should do some of the politically neutral things without signing the form such as the tuition freeze, controls on the administrative costs, etc. because they are the right thing to do. The controversial items on the compact may reduce the appeal to some students and cause certain desirable faculty members to leave. Additionally, we introduce the possibility of a presidential administration in the future who disagrees with the Trump administration deciding that they should punish us for signing the compact, and the Trump/Vance administration adding more terms for funding as time goes on that may align with the university’s mission. I do not believe that there will be some boilerplate contract that is created that will ensure we get any sort of permanent funding increases."
365,0,"Concerning route for Vanderbilt, little benefits packaged with agenda"
366,0,The government has no place in mandating what ideals a private university can or cannot teach. This is an infringement on the rights of an institutionally neutral academic space.
367,0,"To me, I would see this as a clear departure from Vanderbilt's historical value of political neutrality in its academics."
368,0,"As a queer student, conservative ideas directly harm me such as how marriage being between a man and woman. That idea directly affects me and can make me feel unsafe."
369,0,Institutional Neutrality
370,0,It is an example of governmental overreach over our institution and takes away freedom of decision from the University.
371,0,The clause aimed at protecting conservative values does not align with the institutional neutrality Vanderbilt was founded on.
372,0,Vanderbilt would compromise its institutional neutrality by signing the compact
373,1,Too much international
374,0,"I don’t like the precedent it sets. I don’t want to represent a university that bends to the will of the US government. As it stands they say jump we say how high, and I don’t think we’re asking for enough before that. There’s not incentive for us as an institution. I think it violates our institutional neutrality if we conform to their idea of gender."
375,0,"Seems too meddlesome, and deals with too many things at once. Also sets terrible precedent for future."
376,0,"so many things are wrong with this- there are many discriminatory factors that come into play when signing this- for one, ACT/SAT tests have a lot of racial and wealth inequality as students from higher income levels are able to afford to retake the test and pay for tutors while students from lower income levels are not —> there is nothing to account for these economic disparities other than allowing students to apply test optional; additionally, if we sign this, then what will we have to sign next and this doesn’t fall within our neutrality stance"
377,0,It gives the federal government needless control over our education and seeks to use our campus as a tool to promote a political agenda by aligning the university with the politics of the Trump administration. It hands over much of the university's power and autonomy to a politican who has already caused great damage and harm to many across the country and world and whose political postions are found unfavorable by the majority of the Vanderbilt community.
378,0,"I don't think the University should sign any compact, the government shouldn't have control over how the university chooses to operate if it's a private school"
379,0,It goes against Vanderbilt's entire philosophy of institutional neutrality. Furthermore it sets a dangerous precedent that favors one side of political thought.
380,0,"I am hopeful that there is little deliberation on the Trump administration’s compact, as I believe even the mere consideration of such agreement is shameful. A key pillar of the compact — taking actions against departments punishing or belittling ideas—goes against everything Vanderbilt stands for. What constitutes belittling — anything that’s not conservative? By agreeing to such terms, the university would simultaneously be surrendering its values of “dialogue” and being a place where conversation happens. Instead, Vanderbilt would be opening itself up to shutting down any non-conservative speech. The university would be complicit in, and actively supporting, the incremental, yet deeply consequential steps the Trump admin is taking to infringe upon constitutional values and weaponize government resources in pursuit of a political agenda. Such action is shameful and goes against everything Vanderbilt claims it stands for."
381,0,"These terms are absolutely ridiculous. The only thing that makes sense and would benefit the incoming student body is the tuition rate freeze. But overall, this agenda will marginalize students who aren't from a specific socioeconomical background.  It also places unfair judgement upon individual career / educational choices. The nature of one's major should not determine eligibility on receiving merit-based scholarships. The concept of having this compact already violates the purpose of having a private institution. The government should not be allowed to insinuate its own agenda in private institutions. Asking for such compliance in return of federal favor violates a private university's autonomy in its policy and values. Higher education should not ingratiate with the federal government. Education should not follow a certain doctrine nor only be granted to a small group of people with immense privileges. If ""what people are"" can now come to determine their eligibility for an education, how different is this system from hundreds of years ago?"
382,0,"Institutional neutrality, intellectual freedom and integrity."
383,0,"Don’t want grade deflation, point about shutting down anything against conservative ideas seems scary"
384,0,"Vanderbilt shouldn't bend it's knee to this regime---as representatives to a diverse student body that wants to be on the right side of history, they should stand up for the rights of our students and the American people no matter their identity, creed or origin. Following Harvard's example from earlier this year, Vanderbilt should stand up for itself and oppose the Compact and everything it stands for."
385,0,"it explicitly states that it will regulate our speech for ""neutrality"" and then defines neutrality as no anti-conservative opinions. letting the government create infrastructure to oversee our curriculums, professors, students, and speech so it can pull funding (while stating the university is liable to pay it all back) whenever it sees something it dislikes is going to ruin our university, and result in us losing a good portion of incoming applications and our credibility as an academic institution"
386,1,"While there is little trust with the current administration, and funding for higher education should not be contingent upon a single administration's political beliefs, Vanderbilt has the opportunity to both secure financing and largely retain its existing practices and values. In fact, looking over the outline, much of the compact seem flexible and nuanced."
387,0,"While free tuition for science students (which I am) and freezing tuition is appealing, actively limiting the amount of international students and choosing to protect conservative voices in particular is not an equal tradeoff. Limiting our international body forces us to turn away bright and capable minds from across the world simply because of a quota, Vanderbilt is not an institution run by the American government and thus has no obligation to prioritize the American people, but rather view all applicants as equal. Similarly, the current Trump administration’s view on “conservatism” is increasingly detached from regular political discussion and further into radical ideology that divides people, such harmful speech need not be protected speech."
388,0,We will go down on the wrong side of history if we sign.
389,0,The President should not be controlling operations of a private university.
390,0,It sets a concerning precedent for what the government can control. I personally do not agree that many of the expectations in the compact would benefit the university and would rather harm the very fabric that makes Vanderbilt so special.
391,0,"Vanderbilt shouldn't accept abuse, belittlement, and manipulation from Trump. Fight back."
392,0,DO NOT SIGN
393,0,"short-sighted, counter-intuitively xenophobic"
394,0,"The differential funding of higher education based on capitulation to a government agenda is anti democratic and a complete disgrace to the institutional neutrality that Vanderbilt claims is important to them. While some ideas in the compact are not bad (the requirement to use endowments for students tuition, declaring foreign investments in university) there is far too much transphobic and anti-DEI language in their that will directly harm members of the Vanderbilt community."
395,0,"I have my personal moral and philosophical reasons why signing it would be a terrible idea, but a stronger argument from an administrative perspective is that if we are to follow our “institutional neutrality” policy we cannot implement a political ideology on campus, especially as part of a quid pro quo transaction with the federal government."
396,0,trump just wants control at this point and if diermier goes through with this then our institutional neutrality stance is complete bs
397,0,"The terms are way to broad, and once signed I think that it will give too much power to the federal government"
398,0,"This goes against the whole idea of what Vanderbilt prides itself on: Universities must reform or remove units that “punish, belittle, or incite violence against conservative ideas,” while still enforcing rules against harassment and incitement."
399,0,"So so many reasons, but tuition should not be granted towards major or career interest. As a student pursuing medicine, I would not be able to attend Vanderbilt without financial aid. I imagine the same goes for many other Vanderbilt students— not just in the field of pre-medicine. Your goals and aspirations should not put you at risk of not receiving funding towards an education."
400,0,Trumps attempts to control and regulate college education is a threat to our democracy
401,0,"This is a blatant power grab by an aspiring autocratic regime. American democracy can survive this unprecedented attack on our freedoms, but only if we stand strong in a united opposition to executive overreach. We must maintain our freedoms and independence at all costs."
402,0,Maintaining institutional independence
403,0,"This is an extreme overreach of federal power and this compact is undoubtedly a political trap. No government should be allowed to impose ideological oversight on what is or isn’t allowed to be taught or researched in our university. It is simply unethical, and this compact is a trap to set the stage for academic compliance to government demands. In essence, it is a thinly veiled threat, of which provisions of what is is isn’t allowed at the university is up to the government’s discretion, which so far doesn’t have a great track record for supporting funding for scientific or even medical research. Although some requirements may be undeniably reasonable, such as freezing tuition rates or providing free tuition for hard sciences (depending on your opinions), it is the principle of signing such a political compact that goes against our university’s claimed principle of neutrality. Vanderbilt, and all universities in the compact, must take a stand against the government’s attempt at interfering with the freedoms of higher education. Not doing so would set a terrible precedent, and force Vanderbilt to be compliant with a government that has proven already to be against the principles of academia."
404,0,Getting rid of race & gender in admissions will exacerbate systemic inequities.
405,0,"The US government should not dictate what types of ideas a private university does or does not allow. This is federal overreach and can easily be used to cut ideas that the Trump administration does not approve of. It would be catastrophic for any Gender Studies students, Political Science students, likely history students, and most in the humanities. This clearly also emphasizes hard science majors, furthering the chances that liberal arts students (who are largely more likely to be left-leaning) have their opportunities restricted. It represents nothing but partisanship and overreach, and I would be ashamed of Vanderbilt for signing."
406,0,"While freezing tuition and providing full tuition for those studying STEM and other intensive subjects, Vanderbilt must not surrender one of the foundational tenets it was built upon (discussion of the liberal arts and a place to study all fields) and dedication to institutional neutrality. By complying with Trump's compact, we will lose the ability to provide a safe place for fostering diverse and sometimes conflicting opinions. The government should have no influence over what is to be taught in private schools."
407,0,"This bullet caught my attention as the most unacceptable agreement: Departments that target conservative views: Universities must reform or remove units that “punish, belittle, or incite violence against conservative ideas,” while still enforcing rules against harassment and incitement."
408,0,"the pact has too vague of rules in what they want us to do, and I'm afraid they did this on purpose to start making more specific rules and make us comply to everything if we agree to the pact. I sincerely hope Vanderbilt remains as unaffected as possible by Trump's rule and tyranny until he leaves office."
409,0,"Vanderbilt needs to stand up for our students’ free expression of ideas, which this compact clearly prohibits."
410,0,"I do not agree with the restrictions on speech, behavior, etc that this contract would require. I would take away all integrity of this institution as a place of learning and discussion."
411,0,"I agree with freezing tuition rates, and I think the university should provide more financial assistance to students. I disagree with the rest of the compact."
412,0,"By signing this Compact, Vanderbilt would surrender its institutional autonomy and set a catastrophic precedent. Once this door is opened, the university signals that a political body can dictate its fundamental policies. While these initial demands may appear 'reasonable' on the surface, history shows that compliance only emboldens the demanding party. This Compact is not the final offer; it creates an expectation of submission, ensuring that future political policies will only become more severe, intrusive, and corrosive to the core mission of higher education. This is not a blueprint for academic excellence; it is a framework for state control, imposing ideological compliance akin to the demands enforced by authoritarian regimes like the Chinese Communist Party, and betraying everything America stands for."
413,0,"The rules outlined in the compact are a clear violation of institutional neutrality, free speech, and student belonging. Not only would signing this compact fly in the face of Vanderbilt's values, it would also give the Trump administration leverage to further misuse executive power to force campuses to abide by an ideological agenda, breaking any semblance of academic freedom and self-governance in higher education."
414,0,"This compact is a complete and utter infringement on free speech, and the higher education community would be negatively impacted across the board."
415,1,More funding! Our neutrality principle already covers any arguments that we are preferential to any ideas.
416,0,"I think that signing this compact with the Trump administration is detrimental and would effectively chain the university to him. Furthermore, although there are some parts of the compact I agree with, they are outweighed by the negative effects this compact would have, and also, if we agree to this now, there is high chance that Trump will impose more conditions in the future. Trump is not someone you can negotiate with in good faith."
417,0,"Certain parts sound great, but overall it would violate institutional neutrality."
418,0,"Don’t let the government control private institutions, and threaten to hold funding if they don’t comply."
419,0,The section on conservative ideas gives space to argue against any protest or speech under the guise of it opposing conservative ideas. We would be removing any opposition to “conservative ideas” and making it dangerous for students to speak out against stuff they don’t agree with
420,0,The requests are very broad and loosely defined. The requests make an inherent implication of political suppression that I disagree with.
421,0,"There isn't a point in putting a cap on how many international students should be allowed in. Also the government shouldnt be able to ""punish"" entire departments within universities, unless there's a lawsuit or something going on, I don't think that conservative voices should be erased, but there are some really dangerous ideas that have been promoted under the guise of ""conservative values"""
422,0,"Although funding is crucial for Vanderbilt to continue its research and reputation, it is not something that can be attained by compromising its values. The diverse student body is what makes Vanderbilt unique. Vanderbilt only thrives because it has students and faculty from different parts of the world and with different points of view. Adhering to Trump's restricting compromises is not beneficial to Vanderbilt. If Vanderbilt chooses to accept the money from the president, then the school is letting down its students, faculty, and alumni."
423,0,does not allow for free speech and is basically erasing members of the lgbt community
424,0,Vanderbilt is a neutral party and should not bend its head to a man trying to force academic institutions into his grasp
425,0,There are some good parts but if we are truly committed to being neutral than we will do what we want and not succumb to what an administration wants.  I think there is a danger in punishing speech that goes against conservative views.  I like the capping international students and freezing tuition.  I also wouldn’t be here per the test requirement so I don’t like that.  There are some good parts and some terrible parts.
426,0,"Limiting enrollment from other countries means that people aren't being admitted based on merit. Saying no to students that are otherwise a great fit for our school on the basis of their nationality and ethnicity is unfair because that is not something they choose is not fair. That does not sound like the American Dream that this country was founded on. That does not sound like the ""land of equal opportunity""."
427,0,"Agreeing the the compact as is a blatant insult to the American constitution and broad attack on students all across the country. The adminstration should serve to protect students not hinder them, and all those who come to learn, teach and share ideas. The Compact should not be signed."
428,1,Because it’s common sense
429,0,Agreeing to this compact would go against everything Vanderbilt stands for.
430,0,The federal government should not be deciding which universities deserve funding based off a loyalty test.
431,0,"I don’t want the federal government gaining any additional control over Vanderbilt’s practices and policy, and this just opens the door to them, and risks future overreach."
432,0,"I feel like reforming or removing organizations that speak against conservatives and their view points is an act against freedom of speech, so I believe that the compact contradicts itself."
433,0,"Some concerns:  - Standardized test requirements: Not everyone has equal access to standardized tests. The SAT and ACT both come with fees, and fee waivers only cover up to two takes of these tests. Requiring standardized tests creates a disadvantage for low-income students as, unlike high-income students, they do not have the means to take these tests frequently to get the scores expected at Vanderbilt. I was not test-optional, and fortunate enough to be able to take the ACT as much as I could, but knew several brilliant students in my rural Tennessee community who were limited by how many tests they could afford to take.  - Race/Sex in Admissions: I am a firm believer that admissions should consider the unique situation of every student. Students’ grades, test scores, and extracurricular opportunities that all play a role in their admissions success are heavily reliant on their personal circumstances. People are still discriminated against for their race or sex, which may have a negative effect on their circumstances. I am a white woman, so any consideration of race or sex in admissions would likely be a net neutral for me, but I believe not considering the unique situation of every student paves the way to elite schools like Vanderbilt being only accessible to those who aren’t disadvantaged, creating education gaps and homogeneity of ideas on campus.  - Definition of Sex:  Whether the government acknowledges it or not, modern academics of social sciences and biology have agreed that sex and gender are separate and gender is a social construct. To use the administration’s definition that conflates the two, we restrict our top academics and researchers in social sciences to conform to a notion that has largely been accepted as incorrect in their fields. If we restrict the university’s academics and researchers from teaching and articulating the latest knowledge in their fields, then we jeopardize Vanderbilt’s position as a leading university. - International student cap and “foreign ties”: The United States should take pride that its universities attract students from all over the world, not discourage it. Though I am not an international student, I believe their presence on campus is nothing but beneficial. Restricting and discriminating against international students restricts the diversity and amount of ideas and knowledge that we have at Vanderbilt, which should instead promote diversity of ideas as a learning institution. - Free-speech, neutrality, and anti-conservative departments: I don’t believe that we need to double down on policies that are “against disruptions that block classes or events” as this is vague and can and will be used against student protestors by the government, especially since the compact demands DOJ overreach into the school. Barring anti-conservative views but not anti-liberal views is also contradictory to neutrality. - Expand tuition waivers for “hard-science” majors: As someone who is an engineering major, something likely considered “hard-science”, this policy would only benefit me. I still strongly disagree with its implementation as students should not receive different treatment based on their major. It supports the narrative that social sciences or other fields of study are not as important as ‘actual science’, which is far from the truth; even as an engineering major, I would not be where I am at today without the critical thinking and writing skills I developed in my social science courses. Students will be discouraged from applying to non-“hard-science” majors which would create a surplus of “hard-science” majors. This push by the government seems inconsistent with the policies they’ve already implemented: if this administration promotes a surplus of science majors while at the same time pushing policies that cut funding for scientific research, then it simply increases the amount of science majors who are unable to find jobs due to these cuts."
434,1,More money more money
435,0,Vanderbilt’s commitment to Institutional neutrality and freedom of speech is too important to compromise.
436,0,"Vanderbilt University’s mission lies in the quest to bring out the best in humanity—pushing new ideas into the frontiers of discovery, challenging the limits of what’s possible and working diligently in the service of others. I believe that the best way to do that is to retain our own ability to govern, and not cede that power to the federal government. The wording of the compact, as I see it, offers the promise of nebulous access to additional federal funding in exchange for greater oversight and changes into the educational policies and procedures that the faculty senate has assiduously crafted. Additionally, as an employee of VUMC, our credo describes our definition of excellence in health care, research, and education. I feel tension between goals and motivations of the two institutions and am concerned that if we do agree to this compact, our shared vision for excellence will be disrupted even further.   Unless the senior administration of VU and VUMC determines that the goals and perspectives of the compact are fully aligned with our mission and strategic objectives, I urge them to reject the compact. Instead, I ask that we reaffirm our commitments and distinctives that define us, not by conforming to external pressures, but by staying true to who we already are."
437,0,"There are definitely parts of it I agree with and a lot of others that I don't. I think it is very spilt, and I think about a third to a half of the things on the list would benefit Vanderbilt, but a lot of them would hurt it. I strongly advise against Vanderbilt signing it as is."
438,0,The government shouldn’t try to bribe or coerce higher education institutions. We need to be autonomous; bootlicking won’t save us.
439,0,This goes against our principle of neutrality and threatens free speech and the ability to have open discourse and interdisciplinary courses and discussions. Private institutions should not be so controlled by the government. Withholding funding from schools that don’t comply will only shift research in the country to be unproductive and likely deter potential new students from wanting to come to Vanderbilt if it is under such tight control with limits on freedom of speech and inability to make a stance on anything. It would show they care more about money than the actual value of the education and faculty and student environment here. It would change the university fundamentally for the worse.
440,0,"Vanderbilt University should not be pressured to sign a compact with a list of ideals that violate it's neutrality and force the institution to lean into conservative ideals. Although there are some aspects of the compact that would benefit the student body, the Trump administration should not have any control or say in how Vanderbilt, a private institution, operates in admissions, hiring, or in their curriculum. It is crucial that Vanderbilt maintains their neutrality and holds firm to the institutional values that have guided the university's operations for decades."
441,0,"This is just buying into fascism. If Vanderbilt truly valued the so-called “principle of neutrality” and not taking any specific side, it would leave the compact alone."
442,0,"It is an overreach of government control into education. It is discriminatory against internationals, and will ruin the diverse campus Vanderbilt has, especially if getting rid of DEI. The last portion limits freedom of speech for only conservative ideas, unjustly pushing Trump’s partisan ideas onto students and punishing those who disagree. This is a horrible idea that does not prioritize the wellbeing of Vanderbilt students or the integrity of the institution. Please, do not sign this."
443,0,More harm than good
444,1,"Everything that Trump is saying in this pact goes towards enforcing a better academic future for American students, not that foreign students shouldn’t be allowed to study at Vanderbilt, but it is an American institution with American funding that should go to towards the majority of American citizen students that have applied."
445,0,I’m against capping international students.
446,0,DEI is an important part of our campus community. It allows me to feel safe and helps me succeed as a woman of color in a hard stem degree.
447,0,"I’m fine with everything but the last point. I don’t particularly support anything on here except for providing tuition for STEM studies, but I’m fiercely against the last, very subjective point about “allowing” conservative ideals. It can too easily be misused- wording is too subjective. And it reads like it comes from 1984. Hard pass."
448,0,Government shouldn't be reaching their hands this far...they get some ground and will demand for more. Love Vandy as is
449,0,"DEI should remain in place because although it does not bring equality, it brings equity. Additionally, Trump is just using this as another way to power grab in the US. We as a University should avoid any and all connection to Trump's America."
450,0,"If Vanderbilt is truly a neutral institution, then we would never consider signing this compact in its current state. Neutrality means that voices may be heard, not silenced. This compact actively aims to silence voices. The final clause states that departments targeting conservative views must be reformed or removed. This is a slippery slope, as criticism of conservative views (free speech) would appear to fall under this broad category (belittlement). In addition, defining sex as solely ""male"" and ""female"" is inherently politicized, not reflecting Vanderbilt's policy of neutrality. Vanderbilt should be a neutral institution regardless of anyone's political, social, and personal identities. This compact is not neutral."
451,0,"It represents a government trying to insert their agenda into the education of students. The government should not be interfering with the way that these private institutions conduct their education, and should not be using the governments budget to try and push a political agenda that subjugates a minorities."
452,0,I don’t think that the federal government should have this large of an influence in Vanderbilt University education
453,0,"I don’t think Vanderbilt should sign the Compact as it is because several of its proposed guidelines would undermine the university’s core commitments to academic freedom, diversity, and equitable access to education. While I support keeping education affordable and ensuring that all viewpoints are respected on campus, the Compact’s approach seems overly restrictive and politically motivated.  Capping international enrollment would limit the global diversity that enriches the student body and research community. Eliminating consideration of race and gender in admissions and hiring would erase important tools for promoting inclusion and addressing systemic inequities. Additionally, the clause about disciplining departments for how they handle “conservative ideas” could be used to suppress open inquiry or punish legitimate academic critique."
454,0,"While I do agree with some of the stipulations on the compact, I don’t believe Vanderbilt should sign it because it would fundamentally disagree with our current stance on political neutrality."
455,0,"If academic freedom and principled neutrality mean anything to this university, they will not sign it."
456,0,"The only major issues I have with the Compact are the free speech/discipline, tuition waivers for hard science students, and departments that target conservative views components. I just do not really understand the intention of the tuition waivers one and am worried about implications for free speech/academic freedom of the other two. However, I know that research is a huge component of the university and that preferential access to grants would be great for continuing to be a leader in research. I also am a bit worried that not signing the compact would create adversity between the university and the administration that I think it would be better to avoid. Overall, I think we should attempt to negotiate some of the terms and ask for clarification in regards to how compliance with the terms will be monitored and potential consequences of noncompliance."
457,0,Do not agree with punishment for criticizing an ideology. It goes against everything Vanderbilt says it stands for.
458,0,"I haven't done a deep dive into the compact, but the idea of an institution being granted preferential treatment and funding because it aligns with the whims of the government sets a terrible precedent. It's difficult for me to say ""no, I would not like my tuition covered because I'm studying a 'hard science,'"" but I can't support it based on principle. Why is there a guideline meant to protect conservative ideas specifically in the compact? Why not ""... and even spark violence against opposing ideas?"" The wording is dangerous."
459,0,I think some of the policies proposed are valid and a good idea. I do not think it is the role of the federal government to make these decisions for the university. Nor should they threaten funding if the university refuses to do so. Just because some of the ideas are good and have merit doesn’t mean that the government should be the ones deciding what is appropriate for each university or that all of these policies should be controlled by the government. How can a university maintain neutrality and do it as best for the students if they are making decisions out of fear of loss of funding
460,0,Preserving our legacy and integrity matters more than any amount of money.
461,0,"Although, per limited research it seems like this won't change any of Vanderbilt's policy drastically (for example, the cap of international enrollment) I think it completely goes against the institutional neutrality Vanderbilt's administration cherishes. Complying with the wishes of an extremely polar political party is taking a side, regardless of the conditions surrounding it. Considering vanderbilts neutral stance. They would have to balance this with a contribution/alignment with ideals contrasting this. That will not happen, and therefore this agreement should not be signed."
462,0,I think the main issue lies in the last point. It stifles free speech and essentially requires the university to only protect one side of the political spectrum which goes against institutional neutrality. This is likely only the beginning of the demands and will not be the end.
463,1,I believe American universities should first and foremost educate American students. I believe a college education should be affordable. I believe conservative ideas on this campus are often ridiculed and dismissed as bigotry.
464,0,"While some of the ideas of the compact have merit, such as freezing tuition and pushing universities to offer more financial aid if they have a large endowment, many of the principles seem misguided. A blanket cap for international student admissions is counterintuitive to the administration’s past claims that they want the “best of the best” from around the world. Overall, the compact seems to function more as a test to see which universities will fall in line behind Trump without questioning his authority, and it would be shameful of Vanderbilt University to accept it without, at the very minimum, negotiating/removing some aspects of the compact."
465,0,"I believe this amount of political influence against any university by a government, be it foreign or domestic, is unethical and harms the educational opportunities of each student who attends. I chose Vanderbilt for its principled neutrality, commitment to academics removed from politics, and strong adherence to its principles. Because of this, I cannot see a way in which signing this compact is in line with Vanderbilt's mission or culture."
466,0,we should counter
467,0,"While lowering tuition would be ideal, that is obviously not the purpose of this compact. This is a threat towards our first amendment rights that allow us to protest Trump's MAGA, or terrorist, agenda."
468,0,"""Universities must reform or remove units that “punish, belittle, or incite violence against conservative ideas""- this is absolutely propaganda. Despite promising institutional neutrality, anything that is considered to ""belittle"" conservative ideas isn't allowed? That is not neutrality. I've heard multiple times that this campus is meant to be a neutral space for dialogue. This does not achieve that at all."
469,0,The guidelines are ridiculous. Trump's administration is ridiculous. Don't bow down to this nonsense.
470,0,FUCK NO
471,0,"Vanderbilt does not need money from the government, we only give them more control over us in the future by signing this contract."
472,0,"The ideas on it are too conservative, and the Trump administration don’t have the right to do some of the stuff they are suggesting."
473,0,This is inequitable and discriminatory on multiple fronts.
474,0,"Vanderbilt University should refrain from signing the Compact for Higher Education because doing so would risk both marginalizing members of its own community and compromising the university’s academic integrity. First, the Compact’s language and implementation disproportionately affect gender-nonconforming and transgender students, many of whom already face barriers to inclusion and recognition on campus. By aligning with a framework that fails to account for the diversity of gender identities, Vanderbilt would alienate students who depend on the university’s commitment to equity and belonging. Second, the Compact undermines the merit-based principles that ground scientific research and higher learning by selectively awarding stipends and grants to institutions that agree to its terms, rather than to those producing the most rigorous and innovative scholarship. Participating would signal that Vanderbilt prioritizes political conformity over intellectual excellence—an outcome fundamentally at odds with its mission as a world-class research university"
475,0,"While some of the clauses may be beneficial for students, there are certain things that are too important to the university and students for the compact to make sense."
476,0,"This compact goes against Vanderbilt's principle of neutrality. Neutrality is an oat the university has made with its students before we chose it as our university, and it should stand firm as is our commitment towards the university now and for years to come. Capping the percentage of international students goes against the commitment of free expression and civil discourse it intends to defend. How are we going to meaningfully engage with diverse perspectives if we limit them by the numbers? Vanderbilt is expanding, and sooner than later, the cap would be unsustainable for the mission of Vanderbilt for radical collaboration. This is an agreement that could hardly be overturned (not only legally, but on those who are part of this community), and, based on everything the institution has promised to defend, signing the compact would dismantle the core principles of the institution, not because of a political party, but because of the action itself. Please, review each item of the compact and thoroughly understand what it means for the future of Vanderbilt, not putting boundaries where there shouldn't be. We need to uphold our mission for academic excellence with courage and commitment to discussion and learning from one another, something that this compact, as is, seeks to shut down. If there's an opportunity to do a counterproposal with support of the other institutions in this compact, it may support Vanderbilt's commitment to active dialogue. Please, evaluate all the impacts of this, and defend what's best for ALL our community."
477,0,"In my opinion, there should be no regulation on the volume of students from other countries or the limitation of clubs and organizations that criticize conservative values."
478,1,I think the enforcing free speech while also banning any negative views of conservative beliefs is an oxymoron and should be negotiated further.
479,0,This would negatively impact nearly all parts of campus life and would make this university a significantly worse place to be a part of were it to be signed.
480,0,"Destroys and goes against everything Vanderbilt stands for within the realm of Higher Education. Do not give into the cult that is the federal government, continue to be a leader in education by teaching the TRUTH, not conservative filtered content."
481,0,"anything that allows the government to control key metrics, get access to student data, and remove departments or programs is absurd. Government overreach at its finest."
