**Acknowledgments:**
I've taken a lot from lecture notes written by my colleague [Josh Clinton](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/joshclinton/) for prior iterations of PSCI 2300.
My colleague [Jim Bisbee](https://www.jamesbisbee.com/)'s notes for [his offering of DS 1000](https://github.com/jbisbee1/DS1000_S2024) have been helpful too.
I'm also grateful to students from the fall 2024 offering of PSCI 2300 for their suggestions, and to [Nguyen Ha](https://thaonguyen-ha.com/) who gave lots of helpful feedback in her capacity as the TA.
